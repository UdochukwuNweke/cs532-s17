The Adelaide Football Club is pleased to announce a long-term partnership with leading sports apparel company, ISC. 
The Australian company, with a long history in elite sport, will produce the players&rsquo; playing and training gear including Adelaide&rsquo;s famous tri-colour guernsey. 
The partnership is across the club&rsquo;s AFL and SANFL teams, administration and support staff, for the next five years. 
Crows Chief Executive Officer Andrew Fagan said the Club is thrilled to have a long-term agreement with an iconic brand. 
&ldquo;ISC has a range of high performance clothing that will serve our players well and is sure to be popular with our supporters too,&rdquo; Fagan said. 
&ldquo;In a fitting piece of symmetry ISC was established in 1991, the same year the Adelaide Football Club played its first season in the AFL. 
&ldquo;During those 25 years they have become an industry leader in sporting apparel and I look forward to both organisations growing through the partnership. 
Fagan also acknowledged the contribution and support of previous apparel supplier BLK following its two-year association with the Club. 
ISC&rsquo;s Brett Corrick said his company also looked forward to partnering with Adelaide. 
&ldquo;ISC is delighted to join the Crows for the next five years,&rdquo; Corrick said. 
&ldquo;At ISC we like to partner with like-minded organisations and we feel that the high performance nature of the Adelaide Football Club is a perfect match. 
&ldquo;We have invested significant resources into the development of athlete&rsquo;s technical sporting apparel and fan gear and are excited to bring that expertise to the Crows.&rdquo;
