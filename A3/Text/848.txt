CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Jeff Rutter opened his postgame press conference with a 66-second summation of Drake’s 71-63 loss to Northern Iowa on Saturday. He touched on the Panthers’ stout defense and the Bulldogs’ inability to hit timely shots, among other things, as the game’s deciding factors. Shortly after his opening statement, Rutter was asked about his commitment to the long ball even after going 6 of 29 on Saturday. He didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely,” Rutter said. “We’re very intentional about getting clean 3-point shots. We believe that’s a strength of our team, and we’ll continue that throughout the season.” Drake’s mark of 20.7 percent from deep against the Panthers was its second-lowest 3-point shooting performance of the season, trailing only the 3-for-15 showing against UMKC in mid-November. It was a stark step back from how the Bulldogs’ previously shot from deep — especially at home. The Bulldogs entered Saturday’s matchup with five straight victories at the Knapp Center, during which they morphed into one of the Missouri Valley Conference’s best shooting teams. In those five victories, Drake shot 45.7 percent from beyond the arc. But during last Tuesday’s game at Missouri State, Drake shot just 9 of 32 from deep, marking its lowest 3-point shooting performance since it went 10 of 36 against South Dakota State on Dec. 19. Those struggles carried over into Saturday’s contest. GAME RECAP: Northern Iowa tops Drake at the Knapp Center Against the Panthers, Drake missed its first six 3-point shots, a skid that ended when Graham Woodward drilled one after 9 minutes and 22 seconds had passed. The Bulldogs went on to miss another six in a row, finishing the half down 25-22 and 1 of 13 from deep. Part of this was Drake’s inability to knock down open looks, Rutter said, but another reason was Northern Iowa’s stout defense. The Panthers allow just 66 points per game, good for fourth in the Valley and 52nd nationally. “Everything comes down to our defense,” Northern Iowa junior forward Klint Carlson said. “We started this year with one of the better defensive teams that I think I’ve ever been a part of. We’ve been holding teams to low scores. “At the beginning of the second half, they went on a little bit of a run, and we just had to buckle down and stick to what we’ve been doing. We just had to get stops on defense.”   Buy Photo Northern Iowa guard Jordan Ashton (23) and Northern Iowa guard Jeremy Morgan (20) knocks the ball away from Drake guard Ore Arogundade (23) Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017 during Northern Iowa&#39;s 71-63 win over Drake at the Knapp Center in Des Moines. (Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)  Indeed, Drake stormed back to score on four of its first five possessions in the second half, punctuated by a triple by De’Antae McMurray — the team’s second of the game to that point — to tie the contest at 31. But, like Carlson said, the Panthers buckled down, forcing the Bulldogs to miss their next five 3-point tries. It was part of a stretch where they missed nine consecutive shots while Northern Iowa surged ahead for good.

He would finish 3-for-6 from deep, making up half of Drake’s made 3-pointers on Saturday. “They were in the right spot at the right time always. Very well coached. They just executed really well, and that made it hard to find chances to score.” MORE DRAKE COVERAGE : Hoops Therapy: Inside Ore Arogundade's rise at Drake Despite Northern Iowa’s tough defense, Rutter believes there are things his team can do better to improve their chances at creating open looks. Part of that is patience, but even then, he said, they still have to knock down the shots. “To start the second half, we adjusted offensively and tried to go to a spread attack with more ball and player movement,” Rutter said. “What’s tempting with that is, even after two passes, we might feel like we have something good. That’s the game of basketball right there. “It’s like a kid walking around the candy shop, and you want to get the first piece of candy that you see, but if you walk around a little bit longer, you might find something better. Again, we want to be aggressive. We want to be on the attack. We want our opponent to be on their heels. “We think we’re a good shooting team. Didn’t shoot as well today. It’s a setback, but it’s not going to make or break our season by any means.” Cody Goodwin covers high school sports, college basketball recruiting and Drake athletics for the Des Moines Register.
