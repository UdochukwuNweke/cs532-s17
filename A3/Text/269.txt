(Photo: AP)  Paul Millsap may be looking at a good night's sleep. The Hawks' forward put up 37 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in his SIXTY MINUTES in Atlanta's 142-139 win over New York, in a game that took FOUR overtimes.  &quot;I&#39;m glad this is over with &amp; we got the win.&quot; That&#39;s EXACTLY right Paul Millsap. #NYKatATL #TrueToAtlanta pic.twitter.com/Y2bBWpbusd &mdash; FOX Sports: Hawks (@HawksOnFSSE) January 30, 2017  "It's a grind," he said after the game, which is an understatement. According to Fox Sports, the 60 minutes ties a franchise record set in 1982. So is he ready to collapse? Not quiet. "Honestly my body feels pretty good," he said. "I was lucky to hydrate and get a lot of sleep last night." Tim Hardaway Jr. played 58 minutes for the Hawks. On New York's side, Brandon Jennings played 53 minutes and Courtney Lee was on the court for 52. Lee also scored this game-tying shot to send it into the third overtime.
