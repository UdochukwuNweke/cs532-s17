Although the digital-only Wave One was the week&apos;s best-selling release &#x2013; of its 49,000 total copies, 38,000 were from &quot;traditional&quot; sales &#x2013; Mayer still had to settle for second place as the Weeknd&apos;s Starboy topped the charts yet again on the strength of huge streaming numbers. In its fifth non-consecutive week at Number One, Starboy sold an additional 56,000 total copies, even though only 20,000 of that sum was generated by &quot;traditional&quot; sales, with the remainder drawn from a flood of SEAs, or streaming equivalent albums. Other than Wave One , only one more new release debuted in the Top 10: AFI &apos;s self-titled LP, dubbed &quot;The Blood Album,&quot; entered at Number Five and 29,000 copies, an improvement over the Number Nine debut of their previous album, 2013&apos;s Burials . La La Land continued to ride the wave of Golden Globe glory and Oscar nominations as its soundtrack finished Number Three for a second straight week, where it was followed by Bruno Mars&apos; 24K Magic (Number Four), the Moana soundtrack (Six) and Post Malone&apos;s Stoney (Seven, up two spots from its Number Nine debut last week). The Hamilton Broadway cast recording, Drake&apos;s Views and J. Cole&apos;s 4 Your Eyez Only occupied Number Eight, Nine and 10, respectively. Next week, Migos&apos; much-anticipated Culture , Brantley Gilbert&apos;s The Devil Don&apos;t Sleep and Kehlani&apos;s SweetSexySavage will become the latest albums attempting to dethrone Starboy .
