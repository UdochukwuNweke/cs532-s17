c&#8217;mon&#8230;nice try, Benedict College Alums! 
I graduated from Texas Southern, but it easy to see that Bethune-Cookman was the most precision-based band. Parallel knee-bend, toes pointed, high marching&#8230;and a wonderful sound. Let&#8217;s give credit where it is deserved&#8230;..

They sound great but were boring as usual! This was a band competition and a band is suppose to show up and show out. The show wasnt memorable. Sorry.

I enjoyed seeing my Alma Mater performing and for the first time. 
Looking forward to many years in the future.

I was very much impressed with the first band. It was there first time being in the BOB but they kept the crowd engaged. Hope to see them next year. The quality was on par with the two Acura&#8217;s and three Honda&#8217;s I&#8217;ve purchased. 
I will be certain to attend their football games to see more. 
Go Tiger!
