Cat Zingano Blasts Amanda Nunes For &#8216;Disrespectful&#8217; Behavior Following Rousey Win

There&#8217;s a lot of people out there bagging on Ronda Rousey following her huge loss at UFC 207 to Brazilian wrecking ball and champion Amanda Nunes. From celebrities like Justin Bieber to other fighters like Miesha Tate and Michael Page, it seems that a lot of people are reveling in Rousey&#8217;s fall. 
Even Amanda Nunes has gone above and beyond on the s**t talk. Maybe it&#8217;s because she keeps getting asked about Ronda and isn&#8217;t interested in standing in her shadow any more following their fight. But whatever the case, she hasn&#8217;t been shy with criticisms, going so far as to say Rousey &#8216;isn&#8217;t a real fighter.&#8217; 
That hasn&#8217;t sat well with fellow UFC bantamweight Cat Zingano, who has her own connections to both Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunes. She was on the receiving ends of one of Rousey&#8217;s infamous routs, getting armbarred in a quick 14 seconds. She&#8217;s also the last woman to defeat Amanda Nunes, finishing her with strikes after a hard fought three rounds. Now it sounds like she wouldn&#8217;t mind putting her fist through Amanda&#8217;s face again, and it&#8217;s because of how Nunes keeps disrespecting Ronda. 
I&#39;m not petitioning a rematch yet @Amanda_Leoa I&#39;ll earn it. You&#39;re disrespectful of @RondaRousey &amp; I detest you being ungrateful @ufc 
&mdash; Alpha Cat Zingano (@CatZingano) January 5, 2017 
Zingano knows what it&#8217;s like to lose spectacularly then suffer through a failed comeback. Following the defeat from Ronda Rousey, she took over a year off of fighting to deal with personal problems that included the death of her husband due to suicide. She came back looking rusty and dropped a decision to bantamweight contender Julianna Pena, but a few wins could put her right back in title contention, especially considering she&#8217;s one of the few women in the UFC who has proven she can handle the heat Amanda Nunes throws. If Ronda doesn&#8217;t return, could Cat be the one to avenge her?

I dont claim to follow or know &#8216;fighter/s etiquette&#8217; but a thing Ive never understood is &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; behavior to defeated opponent. If a fighter wins, and then wants to gloat about said win for however long, then isnt it their prerogative to run their mouth or not? Im mean if said fighter, and it will eventually happen, gets their teeth kicked in the will have to suck up all of the talk coming back at them. So if Nunes want to talk trash now, knowing full well that it will come back tenfold eventually let her. She won. She works hard. Its her ego/reputation on the line.

Some fighters genuinely don&#8217;t like each other but shit talking is usually fake and only meant to drive up PPV sales, one reason I want to take MMA seriously but can&#8217;t. You look at McGregor and Diaz and you&#8217;d think there was as 1000 year old blood feud between them, but as soon as the fight was over they hugged and now compliment each other

Cat Zingano is pissed at how easily Nunes dismantled Rousey, not at her &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; behavior. Rousey was plenty disrespectful to most of the division during her reign, so all&#8217;s fair in love and getting your face bashed in.
