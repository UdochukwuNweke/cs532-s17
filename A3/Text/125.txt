A new Quinnipiac poll released last week shows more American voters support President Trump's executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from several Middle Eastern and North African countries. 
By a margin of 48 percent to 42 percent, voters supported "suspending immigration from terror prone regions, even if it means turning away refugees."

Fifty-three percent agreed and 41 percent opposed such an idea. 
Quinnipiac's assistant director of the poll, Tim Malloy , said Trump's rhetoric on immigration practices may have helped him win the presidency, but that voters have stopped short of supporting a full ban.
