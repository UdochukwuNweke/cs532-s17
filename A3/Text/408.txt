Spicer was asked what this executive order says to Muslims in other countries. 
The White House press secretary answered, &#8220;What this says is we are going to protect our country and our people. There are forty-six other countries that are not part of this, and I think that&#8217;s an important thing to note. Whether you&#8217;re talking about Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, or the UAE. There&#8217;s forty-six Muslim-majority countries that are not in this set. These seven countries were identified by the Obama administration as needing further travel scrutiny.&#8221; 
Nine days into the Trump administration and the nation has been given its first blame Obama excuse from the White House. There is a big policy difference between suggesting nations needing more scrutiny and imposing a ban that is causing chaos across the country. President Trump made the decision to have this executive order drafted. Trump signed the executive order with pride in front of national television cameras. 
There is no &#8220;blame Obama&#8221; here. This is all on Trump. 
The Muslim ban has backfired on Trump, and the argument that it isn&#8217;t so bad because all the Muslims aren&#8217;t banned revealed the weak footing that the administration is on with this issue. 
Obama isn&#8217;t occupying the White House anymore, so when bad decisions lead to bad policies, the responsibility belongs to President Trump. 
As it relates to the Muslim ban, Trump signed it, so he owns it.
