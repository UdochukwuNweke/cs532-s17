COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Donovan Mitchell scored 21 points in the first half and led No. 14 Louisville to a 85-60 rout of visiting NC State on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center. Mitchell, who finished with 28 points, was one point shy of the career-high in scoring he set in Tuesday's 55-point demolition of Pittsburgh. He is now 33-of-63 from the field in the first halves of Louisville's ACC games, including 18-of-30 from 3-point range. U of L (18-4, 6-3 ACC) finished January with a 6-2 record for the month, including wins in six of its past seven games. The Cards' last three wins have come by an average margin of 37.3 points. Louisville is now tied for third in the increasingly difficult-to-predict ACC. North Carolina, at 7-2 in league games, stands alone at the top of the standings. Virginia, at 6-2, is in second. The Cards didn't waste much time in building the cushion, either. NC State's Maverick Rowan hit two early shots, but Louisville took a 21-9 lead into the second media timeout, thanks in large part to Mitchell, who scored the Cards' first 14 points. Mitchell also had eight rebounds, five assists and two steals for Louisville with 36 scouts from 25 NBA teams credentialed for the game. Mitchell, projected as a late first-round pick in this summer's NBA draft by DraftExpress.com, won the matchup against NC State's Dennis Smith Jr., who is considered a likely top-five pick. Smith labored for his season-low eight points, shooting 3-of-12 to get there. NC State's other potential first-rounder, freshman center Omer Yurtseven, struggled, too, tallying seven points and five rebounds. It was the fourth loss by a double-digit margin for NC State, and it came six days after the Wolfpack (14-8, 3-6) beat Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Mangok Mathiang had 14 points and five rebounds for Louisville, continuing his run of strong performances. The 6-foot-10 captain is now 21-of-31 for 48 points over the past four games, averaging 12 points and 11.5 rebounds over those contests. Freshman V.J. King added nine points and a career-high seven rebounds. Deng Adel scored 10 points. David Levitch, making his second career start, had six points, three assists and two steals.
