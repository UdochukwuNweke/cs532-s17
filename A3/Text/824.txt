More info: Twitter / linkedin /  Facebook / Google+   Jan 29, 2017  Share Tweet    Image via Getty/Tim Mosenfelder  MadeinTYO, the Atlanta rapper best known for his viral hit &#x201C;Uber Everywhere,&#x201D; is joining hundreds of Americans who are deleting their Uber account. Sunday afternoon the hashtag&#xA0; #DeleteUber became a trending topic &#xA0;on Twitter as a result of&#xA0;Uber&#x2019;s poorly timed tweet last night during protests at JFK airport . Uber suggested it was trying to profit off President Donald Trump&#x2019;s Muslim ban by lifting surge pricing, which occurred after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance&apos;s announcement of an hour-long freeze on all taxi rides in and out of the airport in support of protesters.

The executive order also states no refugees will be allowed into the U.S. for 120 days. 
Surge pricing has been turned off at #JFK Airport. This may result in longer wait times. Please be patient.

Uber&#x2019;s direct competitor, Lyft, announced they were donating one million over the next four years to ACLU. Last night, a federal judge challenged Trump&#x2019;s ban by granting a stay to temporary block his executive order.

Whatever car service you decide to choose, one of them is currently not in the public&#x2019;s good graces right now. For MadeinTYO, don&apos;t be surprised if he remakes his biggest hit into &quot;Lyft Everywhere.&quot; Pre-rolls in my VIP, right?
