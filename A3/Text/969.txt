Creators Eyellusion hope for hologram to tour with Dio Disciples following Wacken performance
The Dio hologram, along with tribute group Dio Disciples, will perform February 2nd at Los Angeles&apos; The Novo, the site of this year&apos;s Pollstar Awards. The performance is the precursor to a promised Dio Disciples tour in 2017 that will feature the Dio hologram, Blabbermouth reports . In a recent interview, Jeff Pezzuti, the CEO of the hologram&apos;s creator Eyellusion, said the Dio facsimile would be utilized as part of &quot;an over-the-top, mind-blowing experience. We are going to have both live singers with [Tim &quot;Ripper&quot;] Owens and Oni Logan as part of the show, as well as Ronnie appearing throughout the show at different parts, some duets. It&apos;s going to be mind blowing from the fans&apos; perspective. We are going to bring album covers to life. We are going to bring things that are known to Ronnie to life onstage.&quot; The hologram arrived with the approval of Dio&apos;s widow Wendy, who told Rolling Stone in August , prior to its debut at Germany&apos;s Wacken Open Air festival, &quot;I cried the first time I saw it. It was quite, quite scary. Our crew, when they first saw it at rehearsal, they were in tears. It&apos;s absolutely amazing.&quot; While the Wacken performance featured a 1988-era Dio, the tour would revolve around Dio&apos;s &quot;different looks&quot; that correspond with the era of the song that&apos;s being played. Dio&apos;s &quot;We Rock,&quot; &quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Holy Diver&quot; are among the tracks the hologram and Dio Disciples will perform. According to Blabbermouth, Dio Disciples guitarist Craig Goldy defended the decision to perform alongside an avatar of their late frontman. &quot;For so many years, Ronnie always invested big in his live shows as his way to give back to the fans, and that is exactly what we aimed to do with this latest performance. We can&apos;t wait to bring this experience to even more of his fans and perhaps even a newer generation when we bring this incredible live experience on the road,&quot; Goldy said. Following the high-profile arrival of holograms dedicated to Tupac Shakur and Michael Jackson, the estates of artists like Whitney Houston , Patsy Cline , Selena , Liberace and a bevy of dead comedians including Redd Foxx and Andy Kaufman have aligned with hologram makers in recent years, and while each estate promised to tour the respective holograms, none of those treks have materialized yet.
