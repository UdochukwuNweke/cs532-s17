COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  EAST LANSING – Believe it or not, Matt McQuaid is known sometimes by his Michigan State teammates as “Big Shot ’Quaido.” He didn’t earn the nickname anytime recently. They’ve been begging him to shoot. Sunday, when MSU absolutely needed it, he finally did. Even if he should have taken a few more. “How many shots did he get up, eight or nine?” MSU Tom Izzo said, before looking down at the box score. “Five?” Izzo let out maniacal chuckle. He wants more. He made that point abundantly clear to McQuaid during Sunday’s 70-62 win over Michigan . The pump-fakes have to go. “Even in practice, coach is saying, coming off screens, ‘Think shot first,’” McQuaid said. Life is so much easier for MSU when he does. And when he hits them. McQuaid’s nine points Sunday — all from behind the arc — were the most he’s scored in Big Ten play against a team not named Rutgers. Without those three 3-pointers, MSU doesn’t beat Michigan. It’s not just that his points were more than the difference in the final score, it’s when those shots came — all of them at critical junctures. McQuaid needs to realize this — he’s a big part of why his team won Sunday and that makes him a big reason MSU is still on a somewhat sturdy track for a 20th straight NCAA tournament appearance. Had the hesitant McQuaid showed up, MSU would be on the wrong side of the NCAA tournament bubble halfway through the Big Ten season. If the hesitant McQuaid shows during the next nine games, the Spartans might finish on the wrong side. That’s not too much to put on a kid — even a sophomore coming off double sports hernia surgery that cost him any offseason development of his game or body. McQuaid’s a shooter, the only pure shooter on MSU’s roster. His job is to shoot.  With Brian Bowen visiting for U-M game, MSU offers SG Greg Elliott scholarship Couch: Izzo will never shake early years of U-M rivalry  “He missed a lot of months of basketball, crucial months where a lot of people were getting better, he was out,” MSU freshman point guard Cassius Winston said. “We all know what ’Quaid is capable of. (He) won them a lot of games last year. To see him get a couple shots and see those go in, that’s going to help his confidence and we’re going to keep feeding him. Down the road we’re going to need him.” The ball is in Winston’s hands at least 20 minutes a game these days. It’s in Miles Bridges’ hands a lot, too. Both of them control who gets the ball. Both of them Sunday made it clear how much this team benefits from McQuaid’s shot and, as Izzo said, being “willing to shoot.” McQuaid’s first 3-pointer extended MSU’s lead to four points just before the half, giving the Spartans a smidgen of breathing room and sense of momentum. His second 3, early in the second half, gave MSU back the lead for good at 42-40. His final triple, on an assist from Bridges darting toward the rim, pushed the Spartans’ lead back to nine, 54-45, just as Michigan looked poised to make a run midway through the second half. Even McQuaid’s missed fast-break layup over a couple defenders appeared to be taken with confidence. “Confidence is earned, not given,” Izzo said. “The kid’s worked hard at it.” Izzo kept noting how happy McQuaid’s teammates were for him. That’s probably true. He seems like a nice kid, polite, unassuming, a good teammate. But they’re also happy because McQuaid gives them a dimension they don’t have anywhere else — a shooter. Not someone who can shoot, but someone defenses look at and say, “shooter.” There’s a difference. Michigan coach John Beilein understands this difference. “It was only a matter of time until he started shooting better and we made him healthy,” Beilein said. The 3-point line is irrelevant to a point to a pure shooter. When they’re right in the head, that is. Because there may be no worse feeling on a basketball court than to be a shooter without confidence. It’s like being naked in front of 15,000 people. And the only way out of it is to shoot.

Lansing State Journal columnist Graham Couch and Detroit Free Press / LSJ MSU beat writer Chris Solari break down the Spartans win over Michigan and what it means.
Graham Couch / Lansing State Journal  McQuaid is a better overall player than he’s given credit for. As a freshman, he hit big shots in important games and, playing out of position, turned in adequate minutes as a backup point guard. He’s also a better defender than people think. MSU’s win at Minnesota and Sunday against Michigan, — two pivotal wins triggered by defense, including his — are great examples of this. When Izzo was asked about McQuaid’s defensive progress Sunday, he quipped, “McQuaid doesn’t need to make a lot of progress.” But he needs to shoot. Every chance he gets. From 25 feet out, if need be. There is no open shot within that range that’s a bad shot for McQuaid or MSU. Izzo certainly isn’t going to punish him for being ready and willing to shoot and letting it fly. If it’s Izzo he's worried about, he should try pump-faking a few more times and see what happens. “It felt real good (Sunday),” McQuaid said of seeing his shot fall. “Everybody is giving me confidence, telling me to keep shooting.” Keep listening.
