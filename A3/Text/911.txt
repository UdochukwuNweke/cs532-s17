DES MOINES - Lefty&#39;s in Des Moines hosted a benefit for the Animal Rescue League of Iowa Sunday afternoon. The event featured a raffle with an indoor art market and full bar. 
As local 5&#39;s photojournalist Griffin Wright shows us, it&#39;s all about helping out local pets. 
On top of the public&#39;s donation, any pink poodle or lefty bomb ordered, lefty&#39;s donated $1.00 to the ARL.        Copyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
