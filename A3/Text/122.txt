Fresh off their impressive tournament win at "2017 CapU Queens of the Court" in North Vancouver, the Steveston-London Sharks will be looking to add a city title this week as they host Richmond Bantam Girls Championships. 
Coming in to the 2016-2017 season, Steveston-London Sharks Bantam girls basketball coach Rob Urquhart knew he was blessed with a special team. 
Having three medalists from the 2016 BC Summer Games and eight alumni from the successful Richmond Youth Basketball League (RYBL) program, expectations of him and his team were high. 
As the regular season is now concluded and the playoffs are set to begin, to say he made the best of the gift he was given would be an understatement. 
The Sharks started the season with a 3-0 tournament record to win the MacNeill Ravens Classic in early December. They recently finished the regular season with a perfect 7-0 record, averaging an impressive 41-point margin of victory. 
The girls carried their momentum into the prestigious &quot;2017 CapU Queens of the Court&quot; Tournament at Capilano University. They faced strong competition in Lord Tweedsmuir's ‘A’ team, Argyle's Gold team, and Walnut Grove in the championship final. The Sharks finished with another 3-0 tournament record to take first place in the Grade 8 Gold Division. 
The team includes: Samantha Siy, Molly Liao, MacKenzie McDonnell, Sally Li, Doris Liao, Athena Ng, Jasmine Leung, Annalise Wong, Kaitlyn Eng, Mina Chong, Sharlene Siy, Krishangi Dandapure, Alison Xie and Katie Chan. 
Eclipse Malixi and Maggie Campbell round out the coaching staff. The team managers are TJ Cadlaon and Jessie Chan. 
This week's Richmond Championships has unfolded as expected with the host Sharks taking on the McMath Wildcats in Thursday's championship game at 5 p.m. 
At the buzzer… 
Three other city championships are also underway.. 
Unbeaten McMath and host MacNeill are the teams to beat at the Richmond Bantam Boys Championships. The final also takes place on Thursday at 5 p.m. 
Meanwhile, the Sharks are also enjoying a dominant season at the Juvenile Girls level and will be looking to cap a perfect run at Burnett Secondary where they will face RC Palmer in the title game at 5 p.m. on Thursday. 
McMath features one of the top Grade 9 boys teams in the province and are looking looking to earn city Juvenile honours at Richmond High. The championship game tips-off at 5 p.m. on Friday.
