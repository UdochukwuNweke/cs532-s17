COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Derrick Walton Jr. is on an island. On Sunday against Michigan State, it’ll be a green and mostly white island as he leads Michigan into the Breslin Center in East Lansing looking to sustain the Wolverines’ momentum. Not that he minds. As Michigan’s lone state of Michigan rotation player, he has a different feel for the game than his teammates. Walton has only played at Breslin once in his career, as a freshman, sitting out the sophomore year game with a foot injury. U-M did not visit East Lansing last season. “Me and J-Mo (Jordan Morgan) took the game so serious and they had Keith Appling and Denzel (Valentine),” Walton recalled today. “You grow up playing against those guys and now it’s on the highest possible stage of college basketball. It would be hard to replicate. Just like last night ( the 90-60 win over Indiana ). I’m not from Indiana but you’ve got to do it for your brother. If you saw Zak (Irvin) before the game, he was so locked in. I’ve never seen him that locked in. He wanted to win so bad. For your teammates, you want to win for them.” Related:  Michigan basketball is all warmed up for MSU after crushing Indiana   Normally a quiet leader, Walton has a pregame speech ready for this game to remind his teammates how much it means. So he expects the rest of the Wolverines to want to sell out for him in the game, understanding there’s something more at stake than just the next Big Ten victory. That environment is what will fuel Walton. “I love away games,” he said. “When someone boos you, you just want to shut them up. I’m pretty sure guys use that as motivation. There’s nothing like an away win. An away win is 10 times better than a home win in my book, because of the hostility. Knowing you’re coming in with you and your team and having the home crowd behind you makes the win much sweeter.” The Breslin Center is as intense an environment as they’ll play this year. "That atmosphere and the hostility of that crowd is a different monster,” Walton said. “I’m excited for it and I’m pretty sure the other guys are excited as well. There’s nothing like walking into a gym and knowing you’re hated. You’ve got to embrace it and love it.” While that works for Walton, having won the 2014 game 80-75, there could be an intimidation factor for the younger players, especially U-M’s inexperienced big men Moe Wagner and D.J. Wilson. Walton wants them to follow his lead. He knows the chants and the jeers and the vocal nature of the MSU fans, growing up realizing “the Izzone is pretty intense and I’m pretty sure they’ve got some stuff for us.” “I’m pretty sure they respect us,” he said. “But they hate us a lot more than they respect us. That’s just a given. It’s just a feeling that you can’t describe. Knowing that you win on the other team’s court and the game is nationally televised, I’m pretty sure everyone will be locked in. You can’t make that up, you can’t script that any better.” Related:  Miles Bridges: Spartans &#39;emphasizing how much this game means to us&#39;   Except that while this Michigan team has confidence having won three of the past four games, all three wins have come at Crisler Center. The road remains a bugaboo, as Michigan has lost all five true road games this year. Some were close – the overtime loss at Iowa, the four-point loss at Wisconsin, staying with UCLA for 25 or 30 minutes. But their two worst performances of the season came on the road, getting handled at South Carolina and hammered at Illinois. “On the road a lot of things, you’ve got to be borderline perfect,” he said. “You’ve got to get as many layups and convert on free throws and limit as many defensive deficiencies as possible. I think this team has really made that step. We’ve had bumps on the road. I think that’s why we’ve been playing such great basketball going forward. We’re really learning from our mistakes.” Michigan coach John Beilein said it’s an evolution, the growth process for a team learning to win in a hostile environment. In this game, U-M may have crunch time experience with two seniors (Walton and Irvin) and a junior (Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman) in the starting five, while MSU starts four freshmen. Yet the Wolverines will have to show something different than they have previously. They’ve been able to stay close in the early parts of the game, even for much of the first half in most. It’s the finishing that’s the challenge. “We have got to be able to compete down the stretch, stay focused down the stretch and get lucky down the stretch,” Beilein said. “Once those things come together, all of the sudden, it’s ‘oh man we’re a great road team.’ ” Related:  Michigan&#39;s John Beilein impressed with Michigan State&#39;s Miles Bridges    Has Michigan found defensive stopper in Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman?
