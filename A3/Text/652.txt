Rihanna has not minced words in regards to President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order, which temporarily restricts entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. In the immediate aftermath of protests regarding refugees being denied entry into the country, Rihanna took to Twitter and referred to Trump as an &#x201C;immoral pig&#x201D; for implementing the policy.&#xA0; 
Disgusted! The news is devastating! America is being ruined right before our eyes! What an immoral pig you have to be to implement such BS!! 
&#x2014; Rihanna (@rihanna) January 29, 2017 Azealia Banks , who stated she was pro-Trump prior to the 2016 Presidential Election, took issue with Rihanna&#x2019;s statements and threw her support behind the immigration ban in a lengthy Instagram post. Banks referred to Rihanna as someone who &#x201C;isn&#x2019;t a citizen and can&#x2019;t vote,&#x201D; and urged celebrities speaking on the matter to &#x201C;shut up and sit down.&#x201D; 
&#xA0; 
You don&apos;t get to show up in another man&apos;s country, kill his young , his wives, ruin his home and think a peace talk Is going to be the end of it. ITS NOT. There&apos;s absolutely no way to end this war but to finish it ourselves. It&apos;s TERRIBLE, do I agree with it , NO, do I personally like what&apos;s happening , NO! But I can say that as an American who enjoys her safety and overall ability to maintain a certain level of ignorance as pertains to the world outside of our borders , I am 100% shook about open borders and would be reallllllllllllly scared for my self and my family if any parts of that war began to become real on this soil. I like my life the way it is. IM JUST A YOUNG FEMALE RAPPER TRYING TO MAKE MY PAY, I personally didn&apos;t sign up for any of this extra shit and I refuse to involve myself in matters that don&apos;t have anything to do with the African American populace. This is an extension of the crusades , I was in west Africa killing chickens and being primitive while y&apos;all was over there arguing about who the savior is. Please miss me with all of this shit. Pass me a chicken and leave me the fuck alone !

Azealia Banks further added, &#x201C;But I can say that as an American who enjoys her safety and overall ability to maintain a certain level of ignorance as pertains to the world outside of our borders, I am 100% shook about open borders and would be reallllllllllllly [sic] scared for my self and my family if any parts of that war began to become real on this soil.&#x201D; &#xA0;

While not mentioning Azealia Banks directly by name, Rihanna&#x2019;s reply hinted at her being made aware of Banks&#x2019; comments with Instagram shade. Rihanna acknowledged her native Barbados by posting an emoji of the country&#x2019;s flag and joked, &#x201C;The face you make when you a immigrant,&#x201D; in her caption. She also referenced Banks&#x2019; previous admission of allegedly sacrificing live chickens in Brujeria rituals and Sateria practices using the hashtags #stayawayfromthechickens, #iheartnuggets and #saveourhens. 
&#xA0; 
Never want to take this much credit as I obviously don&apos;t know it ALL, but I&apos;ve been right too many times for my opinions to be considered invalid.

After well publicized spats with T.I., Iggy Azalea, and Erykah Badu, it appears Azealia Banks isn&#x2019;t changing her social media behavior in 2017.
