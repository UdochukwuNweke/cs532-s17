President Donald Trump's sweeping executive order on immigration
includes a plan for sanctuary cities to publish weekly a list of
crimes committed by "aliens."
Under a section on " sanctuary
jurisdictions ," the executive order called for the Department
of Homeland Security to put out weekly a "comprehensive list" of
the crimes.
The section of the executive order reads:
"To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats
associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the secretary shall
utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent
and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of
criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that
ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect
to such aliens."
The wording did not make clear whether the "aliens" — foreigners
— referred to were undocumented, or illegally in the country.
Trump's executive order called for "sanctuary jurisdictions" to
comply with federal immigration law or have their federal funding
pulled. The only exception was for federal funding deemed
necessary for law-enforcement purposes by either the attorney
general or Department of Homeland Security.
During an address to the department on Wednesday after he signed
the executive order, Trump said, "We are going to restore the
rule of law."
