​Does somebody near him want to remind Grayson Allen to grow up, or is that our job? Because every game, home or away, rain or shine, there's always something immature going on with the Duke Blue Devils and it's always traceable to Allen. With just over five minutes left in this chippy, and overly foul-filled contest, Allen extended his arms, and a sea of carnage followed him to the bench.   Everyone loves Grayson Allen just in time for Valentine's Day. #Duke #WakeForest pic.twitter.com/Xa2440aok7 — SixPackABSurdity (@6PackAbsurdity) January 28, 2017  ​​This nonsense resulted in a Wake tech, but it also resulted in Allen being bodyslammed into a pile of chairs. Genuinely unclear why they decided on this moment to bring the ruckus, but it was likely due to a quick glance at Allen's face.   pic.twitter.com/zqzNdSNTNE — Tate Frazier (@tatefrazier) January 28, 2017  This just won't stop. You can't count on it ever stopping. PHOTOS: COLLEGE BASKETBALL SEASON
