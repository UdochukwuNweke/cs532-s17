LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Editor's note: An updated story on J.P. Prince can be found here . Former Tennessee guard J.P. Prince and Texas A&amp;M center Joseph Jones are stranded in Dubai after Iran refused to let them return to the country after a team trip. Both Americans play professional basketball in Iran for Azad University Tehan, but they were barred from the country, according to a report from The Vertical due to Iran's ban of American citizens. The measure was retaliation for an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which temporarily bans citizens, regardless of their immigration status, of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States. “We are waiting for clarity from the team,” Eric Fleisher, the agent for both players, told The Vertical. “It’s tough. It doesn’t look like they can finish the season in Iran. It’s not good to be out of a job. Secondarily, all their things are in Iran. They can’t go back and get them. It’s been difficult.”   247SPORTS J.P.
