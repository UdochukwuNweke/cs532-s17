Published on Jan 29, 2017 Black Nerd Review of The New Edition Story on BET. SUBSCRIBE for Andre "Black Nerd" Videos! http://youtube.com/blacknerdcomedy?su... Andre "Black Nerd" Review of The New Edition Story, the 3-part BET mini-series movie about the rise and drama of New Edition and its various solo careers for Ralph Tresvant, Bobby Brown and Bell Biv Devoe. Plus how New Edition plays a big part in my personal nostalgia for music of the 80s and 90s. Note: Trailers and Clips from BET Networks social media for Black Nerd Comedy to use as press for news, reviews, criticsm and commentary purposes under rights of fair use. All opinions are 100% my own with NO outside influence and NO compensation.
