New Music: King Harris &#8220;Birds Of A Feather&#8221;

Even as a new artist, King Harris has one royal foundation. Raised in Long Beach, developed in Oxnard, California the MC who uses his government name has collaborated with E-40 (&#8220;Thirsty&#8221;), toured the country with his cousin Jay Rock and Tech N9ne and been a fixture in the studio with Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolboy Q. Now, he&#8217;s teaming with Gangrene&#8217;s Oh No for his debut album, Nightmare On Wolff Street , a breakthrough project in a career and a life that truly stands out.         &#8220;Oxnard has always been a breeding ground for that sound that&#8217;s popular,&#8221; deduces King in a year where natives Madlib and Anderson .Paak have been behind two of 2016&#8217;s biggest albums ( The Life Of Pablo  and Malibu ). &#8220;When somebody from Oxnard gets on, that&#8217;s the little door, and then it turns into a big hole.&#8221;    By 16, dividing his time between the LBC and his grandparents&#8217; place in Oxnard, King Harris began to earn off-the-books money &#8220;I was selling crack at 16 in Oxnard. All the stuff that I rap about now, more than likely, it happened in Ox. But as far as gangs and all that shit, that&#8217;s Long Beach.&#8221; While his cousin Jay Rock would sign a major label deal, Harris was not putting in the necessary work. &#8220;I was always serious about Rap, but I never wanted to take pointers from anybody.&#8221; In 2008, King would go to county jail and then prison for robbery. After serving his bid, Harris could not adapt. &#8220;When I got out from jail, I was trying to fly straight&#8212;but I couldn&#8217;t find a job to feed my family. I got back into selling drugs.&#8221; It was here that King Harris viewed his passion differently; and got the concept for his debut album (he was arrested on &#8220;Wolff Street&#8221;).        While incarcerated King sharpened his pen and wrote his way out of a criminal life. Seeing Jay and the genesis of TDE on prison TV sets inspired him. Upon his release in 2010, his cousin from Watts paid him a visit. &#8220;Jay Rock drove up to Oxnard. We did all the shit cousins do, go out to eat, catch up.&#8221; Before they parted, King wanted to show Jay what he&#8217;d been up to. &#8220;I wanted to kick somethin&#8217; for him that I wrote when I was locked up. You know you spit a dope verse when the nigga you with gotta get his rhymes ready to come back at you.&#8221;         Between 2010 and 2012, King Harris would become a staple at Top Dawg&#8217;s headquarters. There, he fellowshipped with Kendrick, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q. In a tight-knit crew of visionary artists, Harris was embraced. &#8220;I was rollin&#8217; around with TDE, I had just as much access to the studio as anybody else. King also fostered a bond with Strange Music, including touring with Stevie Stone, Krizz Kaliko and Kutt Calhoun and he was featured on Tech N9ne&#8217;s Welcome To Strangeland  tribute &#8220;EMJ.&#8221;        After all of these opportunities, it is time for King Harris to focus on him and he refuses to rely on handouts. &#8220;Jay Rock and Punch are family and believe in me, but they always tell me it&#8217;s about quality, not cosigns&#8221; King asserts.         Teaming with Oh No, they hit the lab and created King&#8217;s debut Nightmare On Wolff Street ; an album that effectively bridges 1988 with 2016 and is inspired by milestone Cali Hip-Hop classics like Snoop&#8217;s Doggystyle and The Game&#8217;s The Documentary (The Game appears on King&#8217;s &#8220;Right Back To The Money,&#8221; a funky concoction of break-beats and boastful bars).        Today, King Harris returns to the dopehouse with another 2dopebozy premiere, &#8220;Birds Of A Feather,&#8221; the new single from his debut album, Nightmare On Wolff Street, which will be released on 5-13-2016.   Welcome (back) to Oxnard!        &#160;        Checkout the 2dopeboyz premiere: here     King Harris Nightmare On Wolff Street will be released on 5-13-2016.
