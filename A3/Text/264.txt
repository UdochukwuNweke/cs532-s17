Social media has delivered its verdict on Ivanka Trump's ballgown, posted to Twitter as chaos erupted in airports across the United States: Not a good look.  On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump issued an Executive Order which essentially closed American borders to migrants and refugees from 7 predominantly Islamic countries, including refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. As a result, many citizens of these countries wishing to enter the US have been detained and kept in limbo at American airports.

Protesters all over the country took to the streets and major airports to demonstrate against the legislation and show their support for those detained.  Many activists, influencers and celebrities used social media to express their outrage over the "inhumane" nature of Trump's ban, some even joining protesters to show support for those refugees and immigrants impacted by the legislation.

At the same time, Ivanka however was using her social media to broadcast a very different message, posting a photo of herself and husband Jared Kushner off to the Alfalfa Club Dinner on Saturday night.  The photo was not well received.

The couple, both close advisors to President Trump with Kushner officially named a senior White House advisor last week, were preparing to leave for the exclusive social gathering attended by the political and social elite in Washington. It's an event Donald Trump himself had attended since 1993, but decided to sit out this year.  The photo was met with immediate condemnation with many Twitter users arguing that it was a callous and inconsiderate time for Ivanka to use her public platform to share her outfit. Many took the opportunity to comment on the poor timing of the post, as well as Ivanka's outfit of choice for the event, which some pointed out was reminiscent of a "baked potato" while others drew a comparison to the foil survival blankets worn by refugees now denied entry on her father's orders.

Others have drawn connections between Ivanka and Marie Antoinette who was notoriously ignorant to the suffering of her people, and upon learning of mass famines and bread shortages in France during her time as Queen, reportedly said "let them eat cake."  
@IvankaTrump Well I'll be damned. Marie Antoinette reincarnated. Little "Let-them-eat-cake-Ivanka." — LaurieFendrich (@LaurieFendrich)

@MattfDoyle @crawdady21 @Eva_Shogouki01 This picture makes me think of a qoute "let them eat cake" right? — nae (@renae_rp)

The controversy comes as Melania Trump drew similar condemnation after appearing on the current cover of Vanity Fair Mexico "eating" a bowl of jewels .
