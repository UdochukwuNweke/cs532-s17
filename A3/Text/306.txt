This private three-week enrichment program offers your child the most innovative and fun approach to playing a musical instrument. Located at Young World Day School in Mahwah, NJ, our facilities offer fully air conditioned lesson and ensemble rooms, athletic field, basketball courts, ping pong table and a saltwater pool. Whether your child is a beginner, an intermediate instrumentalist or just wants to start an iBand with their friends, the Super Summer Music Camp is here to help them make the most of their talents. Our jump-start lessons, electives, and ensembles are taught by highly qualified instrumental specialists who play the instruments they teach. Using 21st-Century learning techniques and concepts, your child is going to love playing an instrument. Even if they've never played a note before, in just three weeks, this accelerated program will have your budding musician actually playing a song on their instrument! The personalized attention given to each child will put them 14 weeks ahead those students who start playing in the fall. That's almost half a year! Each campers' day includes lessons, ensembles, musical forums, hands-on electives, swimming, and many other recess activities. Visit us at www.supersummermusic.com for more information or reach out to the director Erik Jacobsen at erik@supersummermusic.com.
