(Charlie Riedel/Associated Press)    By Jerry Brewer  By Jerry Brewer    Columnist January 29   Follow @JerryBrewer    If you thought the NFL regular season was subpar, then the playoffs have been nothing more than background noise for three weekends of quality nap time. The league often gets away with 58 minutes of mediocre football by closing with two thrilling minutes, but if you ever wondered how the games might be perceived if you took away the late drama, this postseason has delivered an answer. It stinks. It wouldn’t smell worse if you watched the action in a musty locker room and brought out week-old appetizers. Hold your nose and think about how bad the Super Bowl lead-up has been. Eight of the 10 postseason games have been blowouts of at least 13 points. The average margin of victory has been 15.7 points. The road team has a 2-8 record. To compare, at this same point in the 2015 playoffs, seven of the 10 games had been decided by seven points or fewer, the average margin of victory (11.3) was lower, and the road teams were 4-6, sweeping the entire first round. When the New York Giants wide receivers’ party boat is as big a story as the NFC and AFC championship games, you know the playoffs have been as worthwhile as a “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” marathon. If Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers hadn’t drawn up a play on the AT&amp;T Stadium artificial turf two weeks ago and if tight end Jared Cook hadn’t channeled a ballerina on the sideline, these playoffs wouldn’t have a signature moment. If referee Carl Cheffers hadn’t made a controversial holding call on a two-point conversion in the Kansas City-Pittsburgh divisional round game, there wouldn’t be much to talk about other than what you should have already known after watching the four-month slog of a regular season: There’s a dearth of good teams this season. It’s not that a few great teams overwhelmed everyone else. The playoff participants were a motley mix of pretty good, decent and mediocre, and the results emphasized that.  Mercifully, Super Bowl LI somehow has persuaded an interesting matchup to come along. As the customary week of ridiculous hype begins, the 2016 season needs the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons to stage a conversation-altering performance. It’s not that the NFL is in danger of losing its license to print money anytime soon. But after seeing the television ratings decline of the regular season continue into the playoffs, after seeing the quality of the product dip to a level that even the blind faithful can see, after seeing Commissioner Roger Goodell continue to flounder in ignorance, the NFL doesn’t need this funk to linger during its grand international showcase.  [ Brewer: After beatdown of Packers, Falcons look like Super Bowl favorites ]  One event doesn’t make that big a difference, you say? Well, the Super Bowl, with its television viewership of more than 100 million people and its worldwide fame, is the ultimate platform on which to send a message about the health of the game. One Sunday won’t change some of the larger issues — which range from poor tackling to the league’s inconsistent domestic violence stance to ongoing concerns about player safety — but it can reinforce why the game is so popular and, in some minds, an indestructible American passion. The Patriots are back for the seventh time with Tom Brady as their quarterback and Bill Belichick as their head coach, and they’re seeking a fifth championship in this dynastic run. The Falcons, for their part, have no Lombardi Trophies, but they’re fascinating newcomers to elite status, boasting the league’s highest-scoring offense, a charming team-based “brotherhood” philosophy, and the energy of promising second-year Coach Dan Quinn. The matchup has all the trimmings of a good one: tradition vs. novelty; two great quarterbacks, with the all-timer Brady and the still-climbing Matt Ryan; and an explosive offense against a New England defense that allowed the fewest points in the regular season.  [ Svrluga: The NFL’s model franchise was once a tear-down project ]   The Patriots are the most polarizing champion in sports, but they keep winning. They can join San Francisco and Dallas in the five-title club; only Pittsburgh, with six, would have more. And, with a fifth ring, Brady would break his tie with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the most all time. The stakes are historic, and if you’ve been paying attention to the Patriots over the past 16 years, you know about their penchant for playing classic Super Bowls. All of their six previous appearances with Brady have been decided by four points or fewer. Their two losses to the New York Giants were classics, and then their 28-24 triumph over the Seattle Seahawks two years ago may go down as the greatest Super Bowl ever. Certainly, that game had the most-debated ending, with cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepting Russell Wilson’s pass at the goal line, a play on which many thought the Seahawks should have run the ball.  During the 1990s, eight of the 10 Super Bowls were won by double digits. Blowouts became the expectation. But eight of the past nine have been close games. Parity reigns. It has become almost impossible to keep a dominant team together under the league’s hard salary cap guidelines. And even though New England has figured out how to chase titles for nearly two decades, the Patriots have done so by mastering the concept that you can only be great in so many areas. Their greatness lies in both Brady’s longevity and Belichick’s ability to coach around their flaws. They’ve broken or manipulated rules along the way, too. But history will remember the Patriots favorably for how they’ve outwitted a system designed to eliminate teams like them. Parity is a fine concept, but the NFL is starting to suffer from going to great lengths to force it. Sure, it’s nice that the Washington Redskins kept their playoff hopes alive until the final weekend despite a terrible defense and an offense that turned pale in the red zone. But it’s awfully hard to sell the virtue of an entire league when watching these teams makes you uncertain about whether to blow into a paper bag or wear one. The playoffs proved clearly that there weren’t 12 good teams to create a compelling postseason. Heck, just the conference championship games proved there weren’t four good teams to create two measly good games. But there’s still the possibility that Atlanta or New England, or both, has become great. Short of that, there’s still a chance that they’re just good enough to scrounge up a little Super Bowl drama. At this point, the NFL can’t change the narrative that the 2016 season was a crummy one. But a surprise ending would be a reassuring consolation. Not to mention it would keep your much-anticipated Sunday shindig from turning into one large slumber party.
