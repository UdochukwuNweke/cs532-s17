Purdue basketball: Basil Smotherman no longer with team 
Josh Sanchez 
Over the weekend, the Purdue basketball program announced redshirt junior forward Basil Smotherman is no longer a member of the Boilermakers roster. 
According to a release, Purdue coach Matt Painter says the decision for Smotherman to leave the program was mutual. 
&#8220;There are standards and expectations that our student-athletes must follow and Basil has not met these guidelines. We have mutually agreed the best route for him is to no longer be a member of our squad,&#8221; Painter said in a statement . 
Smotherman appeared in 18 games this season, averaging 3.9 points, 1.7 rebounds and 0.8 assists. 
Purdue (17-4) returns to action later this afternoon with a trip to Lincoln to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Tip-off at Pinnacle Bank Arena is set for 4:30 p.m. ET on the Big Ten Network.
