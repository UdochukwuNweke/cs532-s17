Global FC get 'inside info' on Brisbane Roar ahead of ACL playoff
ESPN FC's Jason Dasey and Malaysia assistant coach Brad Maloney break down the 2017 AFC Champions League draw. 
Global FC captain Misagh Bahadoran has already got down to business before their AFC Champions League (ACL) preliminary round tie against Brisbane Roar by getting inside information on the Australians. 
The Philippines' club captain, whose team will be away to Brisbane in Tuesday's one-legged playoff, has reached out to his national teammate Iain Ramsay. He previously featured for A-League sides Sydney FC, Adelaide United and Melbourne City. 
Sydney-born Ramsay, who has a Filipino mother, became a Philippines' citizen in 2015, and has earned 15 caps for the Azkals. 
"He told me they are a very good team and they will attack a lot, so it's going to be a difficult game for us," Bahadoran told The World Game . 
Global became the first Filipino side to reach the second round qualifiers of the ACL after they beat Singapore's Tampines Rovers 2-0 on Jan. 24 to book a showdown against the three-time A-League champions. 
Despite the apparent wide gulf of class between the teams, the 30-year-old Bahadoran has played the game long enough to know that nothing is impossible over 90 minutes. 
"In football, there is always pressure and there is always something to lose. We will play our best and fight until the end, and then we will see the result. We are excited to go there and give them a good game," he said. 
Getting the better of Brisbane Roar, third on the A-League table, would be a tall order for Bahadoran and Co. 
Philippines captain Misagh Bahadoran was one of Global's stars when they beat Tampines Rovers on Jan. 24. 
But the Philippines' side, who were impressive in their win over Tampines, are powered by new imports who could make a big impact for them in 2017. Dutch-born Paul Mulders provides versatility in both defence and midfield, while Japan's Shu Sasaki motored down the flanks in that victory. 
Forward Ahmad Azzawi will again be heavily relied on to provide the firepower after his goal and assist against the Singaporeans. 
Should Global succeed, a meeting against Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua awaits. The Chinese Super League giants recently broke the bank to purchase ex-Manchester United forward Carlos Tevez.
