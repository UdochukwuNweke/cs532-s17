behindthegrooves : On this day in music history: January 29, 1991 - &ldquo;diVinyls&rdquo;, the fourth studio album by the Divinyls is released. Produced by Christina Amphlett, Mark McEntee and David Tickle, it is recorded at Groove Masters in Santa Monica, CA from Mid - Late 1991. After three albums for Chrysalis Records during the 80&rsquo;s, the Divinyls, originally a five piece band, by 1990 is paired down to a duo consisting of lead singer Christina Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. With their contract up at Chrysalis, they are signed by Virgin Records. The album is recorded at musician Jackson Browne&rsquo;s studio in Santa Monica, CA, with the duo being aided by Benmont Tench (keyboards), Randy Jackson (bass), and Charley Drayton (drums), who provide musical support. It yields the bands&rsquo; biggest single &ldquo;I Touch Myself&rdquo; (#4 Pop), becoming the most successful album for the Australian rock duo. &ldquo;Touch&rdquo; is also featured in the film and on the soundtrack for &ldquo;Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery&rdquo; in 1997. &ldquo;diVINYLS&rdquo; peaks at number fifteen on the Billboard Top 200, and is certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.
