Simon Helberg and Jocelyn Towne dressed to protest Donald Trump&#8217;s immigration ban at the 23rd annual SAG Awards. 
Appearing on the red carpet Sunday evening in Los Angeles, the Big Bang Theory star carried a sign reading &#8220;refugees welcome,&#8221; while his wife and fellow actor bore the message &#8220;let them in&#8221; written across her chest. 
Helberg and Towne&#8217;s statements represented a clear condemnation of the president&#8217;s sweeping executive order  issued Friday to block all refugees from entering the country, as well as immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The order has ignited protests across the country, snarled travel across the globe, and created widespread outrage, including among politicians and  celebrities . 
Helberg, who was nominated with his Big Bang Theory cast mates for best comedy ensemble on Sunday, has been a frequent Trump critic on Twitter .
