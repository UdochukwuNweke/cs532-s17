Jan 26, 2017  Share Tweet     As a part of the promotional tour for his upcoming album&#xA0; I Decided , Big Sean stopped by The Daily Show with Trevor Noah , where the rapper discussed everything from taking Ls to the current state of hip-hop. He also took the time to address an issue that literally hits close to home: the Flint water crisis . During the interview, the 28-year-old revealed his Sean Anderson Foundation &#xA0;had raised $100,000 to support the residents of Flint, Michigan, where the drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead. Sean, who grew up in Michigan, revealed his mother had experienced lead poisoning, but was able to reverse its effects with &#x201C;holistic care and homeopathic remedies.&#x201D;   Related Watch Big Sean Perform &quot;Bounce Back&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning Jetpack&quot; on &#x27;SNL&#x27; Watch Big Sean Explain the Concept Behind &#x27;I Decided&#x27; on &#x27;The Tonight Show&#x27; Big Sean Shares New Song &quot;Halfway Off the Balcony&quot;  &#x201C;I just know it&#x2019;s not even close to being over. In that situation, I feel like, it wasn&#x2019;t a natural disaster. It&#x2019;s something that should&#x2019;ve been prevented and could&#x2019;ve been prevented,&#x201D; he explained. &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s just disgusting to think about the damages that these families and even kids have to go through with the lead poisoning.&#x201D; Sean also revealed that &#x201C;Bigger Than Me,&#x201D; the closing track on I Decided , will feature the Flint Chosen Choir. He said he wanted to also show his support from his home state through music: &#x201C;Once you hear it, you&#x2019;ll see why I wanted them to be on that,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But I was just happy to have Flint be a part of my album in that way, as well.&#x201D; You can check out the full interview above.
