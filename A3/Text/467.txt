CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  LEXINGTON, Ky. — Kansas freshman Josh Jackson cannot be defined simply; he’s far too versatile for that, as myriad attempts at describing his skill set can attest. He’s a true positionless star, a matchup nightmare for any opponent. He has incredible court vision and is excellent in transition. By the final buzzer of Saturday’s top-five matchup against Kentucky, this description fit Jackson as well: The best freshman on a court filled with at least two other future lottery picks. Jackson’s final line: 20 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals. “I thought he was really good,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said after Kansas’s 79-73 win. “He got his hands on loose balls, and he rebounded great. His offensive rebound putback late was a huge play (to put Kansas ahead for good). To me, he’s a complete basketball player. He’s one of the few guys out there who can do a little bit or a lot of everything.” MORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL  Switch to zone paves way for Kansas comeback against Kentucky    Surprising rise for Josh Pastner, Georgia Tech    No. 3 Gonzaga rolls past Pepperdine, could be bumped up to top ranking   Though that’s been true of Jackson all season, there has been one knock on his game, at least until very recently: That he couldn’t shoot well enough. It was fair criticism through the season’s first couple of months, and even after a recent three-game stretch — he’s 8-for-14 from beyond the arc during the span which includes road games at West Virginia and Kentucky — his season average from three remains only 31.9%. But that will only go up from here, as long as Jackson keeps trending upward. Self said that part of Jackson’s game is evolving well, and his teammates expect it to continue. “He’s definitely trying to assert himself now,” junior guard Devonte’ Graham told USA TODAY Sports. “We as a group try to instill that confidence in him, telling him to keep shooting. A lot of guys are playing off him, so when guys are doing that we tell him to shoot every time he’s open. I think that gives him confidence. “For him and for the next level, he’s going to have to establish that jump shot. But he’s been knocking it down.” RANKING COLLEGE BASKETBALL'S BEST PLAYERS    Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Ranking the 10 best college basketball players in the nation  Fullscreen    Post to Facebook  Posted!

Not every elite freshman steps into a situation as appealing as Jackson’s — joining already arguably the nation’s best backcourt, one that features two upperclassmen who have blossomed into two of the country’s best guards after being largely overlooked during recruiting. Not only have both been tremendous leaders for the 6-8, 207-pound freshman star, encouraging his development as a long-range shooter, but they’ve both also challenged Jackson to be more competitive and to find the right situations in which to assert himself on the court — which he’s starting to do more and more.  Bronson Koenig becomes Native American role model he never had    Luke Kennard&#39;s dagger three-pointer saves Duke for much-needed win   That all leads to the same result: A more comfortable, confident and loose superstar, someone who is even more difficult for other teams to scout and prepare for. Which makes Kansas even more dangerous as it heads into the final month of conference play. “He’s settled into our situation, that we’re going to have to play small,” Self said. "He’s figured out, ‘I can be a three man, a guard, and just because we play (me at) the four doesn’t mean I’m a big.’ But he’s got a big guy guarding him, so I think he’s kind of figured out how to take advantage of that. “He’s a matchup nightmare, just like a lot of four men who can pass, dribble and shoot. He’s a great kid, great attitude. He’s tough as nails.” HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPS    Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Best of this week's college basketball action  Fullscreen    Post to Facebook  Posted!
