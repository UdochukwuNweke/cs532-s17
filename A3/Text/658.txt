California Chrome, the Los Alamitos-based thoroughbred who closed his stellar racing career with a disappointing ninth-place finish in the $12 million Pegasus World Cup on Saturday, came away from that race with a knee problem that may require surgery, the Daily Racing Form reported. Jockey Victor Espinoza appeared to ease off in the saddle after California Chrome began to fade down the back stretch of the inaugural Pegasus, which was won convincingly by &#x2019;Chrome rival Arrogate. California Chrome finished 29 1/2 lengths back. 
In the barn after the race, California Chrome trainer Art Sherman said the horse was detected to have some fluid in his right knee, but the injury did not appear to be serious. &#x201c;It might be a chip, which we could take out arthroscopically,&#x201d; Sherman said. Sherman and Espinoza said they sensed something wasn&#x2019;t right with their horse shortly before the start of the race at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Both said the horse seemed a bit reluctant to enter the starting gate. &#x201c;He took back a little, like he didn&#x2019;t want to go in the gate,&#x201d; said Espinoza. &#x201c;Maybe he was trying to tell me something was not right.&#x201d; 
Espinoza said he knew the horse was struggling about a half-mile into the 1 1/8-mile race. &#x201c;Coming to the half-mile pole he was empty,&#x201d; he told reporters. &#x201c;Arrogate was inside me and I wanted to go with him, and I can&#x2019;t. There was nothing I could have done different. He just completely shut down. &#x201c;Hopefully he&#x2019;s OK. It looked like he was OK. It really surprised me, because he never really ran a bad race before today. Sometimes they have physical problems, or you think you could have ridden them a little differently. But that wasn&#x2019;t the case today. I can&#x2019;t ask any more from him, all he&#x2019;s done for me, all he&#x2019;s done for the sport. He just didn&#x2019;t have it today.&#x201d;
