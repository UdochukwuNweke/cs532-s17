CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Anas Mahmoud is one of the lucky ones. He is a 7-foot Muslim who has managed to blend in. The University of Louisville’s Egyptian center says has felt no discrimination in America and encountered no hostility. Until Saturday morning, he was blissfully unaware of President Donald Trump’s executive order barring entry to citizens of seven countries with Muslim majorities. He has been able to find equilibrium amid all of the turbulence emanating from the new occupant of the White House. Despite his elevated vantage point, Mahmoud has seen no great cause for concern. “I’ll be able to stay here, thank God,” he said Sunday afternoon. “I’m here. I’m going to be playing basketball. As long as I can do what I want and what I came here to do, that’s what matters to me.” MORE CARDS COVERAGE  ►  No. 14 Louisville blasts NC State  ►  Mitchell's play a silver lining amid injuries ►  Transcripts: Gottfried, Pitino talk U of L victory ► Immigration order won't affect U of L players  As demonstrators welcomed refugees at entry points across the nation Sunday, including Louisville International Airport, Mahmoud found sanctuary at the KFC Yum! Center. He started U of L’s 85-60 victory over North Carolina State, contributed a one-handed dunk and two rebounds in 14 mostly uneventful minutes. Though his overall statistical showing was sub-par, it was not because he was weighed down by world affairs. “When I’m on the court, it’s straight basketball,” Mahmoud said. “Basketball has been my happy place. When I have a bad day or something, I go shoot some balls and play some basketball. That’s where I have the most fun.” If sports sometimes provides spectators an escape from the harsher realities of life, they also can act as a protective bubble for the participants. With a game or a practice in progress, athletes are hard-pressed to indulge in social media, to channel surf for headline news or to engage in political debate. They can become so insulated from external influences as to seem out of touch or oblivious about current events. Accordingly, it is easy to envy them at times like these, when divisive policies accentuate our discord and imperil our peace. It was easy to watch Anas Mahmoud on Sunday and worry if the irrational fears and undisguised xenophobia of the new administration will allow him to feel welcome in our nation of immigrants. When your instinct is to apologize to foreigners for the way they have been treated in this country or how they might be perceived by some of its citizens, that’s a pretty good sign of a problem. To the extent that Mahmoud’s competitive cocoon has shielded him from some of our recent rancor, that’s a blessing. “What I understood, it’s not really like a Muslim ban,” he said, seated at his cubicle during a post-game interview. “It’s more about countries that are not stable or something.” He was asked if he had discussed the issues with his relatives in Egypt. “About that topic, not really,” he said. “... I’m pretty sure if my dad knew anything, he would have called me and asked me. But as long as he didn’t ask me anything, he’s not really worried about it.” Mahmoud said he had been told of a heckler being ejected from Louisville’s Jan. 14 game against Duke, but university officials found no evidence of such an incident. He said he gets upset when Muslims are stigmatized, but that he has not experienced it in Louisville. “Everybody loves us,” he said of the basketball team. “Everybody loves me personally. I don’t know how they feel about other people, 'cause I never see that. ... (But) Everybody’s welcomed me everywhere.” Citing the demands of his class schedule, Mahmoud makes most of his five daily prayer sessions in his room. He observes the Muslim practice of daylight fasts during Ramadan, but reports that he tends to put on weight. “I don’t know why,” he said. “But you’re fasting during the day and then, as soon as the sun goes down, you start eating. You keep eating 'cause you know 10 hours from now you’ll be fasting again.” That, too, is a blessing. For if U of L coach Rick Pitino has a concern about Anas Mahmoud, it is that he is too thin.
