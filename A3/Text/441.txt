Published on Sep 9, 2014 XSeries Music / Extreme Music Name: I Am The Enemy Album: Battle Rock 2 Composer: Murphy/Bojanic/Emanuel/Hooper/Cooke/Armstrong Band: All Good Things Instruments: Electric Guitar, Male Vocal Publisher: The Extreme Music Library Ltd (PRS) https://www.extrememusic.com/ https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bat... Image: http://alexiuss.deviantart.com/art/HO... Lyrics: Come night , you can watch my eyes Lighting up like I'm seeing red Don't deny you're petrified Like you're looking at the living dead I'm the silhouette you cant forget Not a sight and not a sound Before you get your finger down on the trigger I'll knock you out and lay you down  Cos I COME IN FAST So I move in close So I move up inside your mind, you tried running to hide I'm the ghost that you fear the most So I come in fast So I move in close So I move in till we collide, I'm wide-eyed and alive Got you tied to the whipping post  CHORUS 1We once stood face to face But you cower at the sight of me You run the other way Cuz I am the enemyI put you in your place You pray for security Cuz I am the enemy I am the enemy VERSE 2 Everything you know, everything you planned All your tactics like match sticks go up in smoke it's no joke that I'm here for the hat trick. man vs. machine. You're going down. I know exactly where you'll be So I come in fast So I move in close So I see you on the sideline while I'm out playing the field I'm shooting goals while you're hitting the post so I come in fast So I move in close Yeah I know that your trying to find my weak side while I'm pushing the slide on high, in 30 seconds you're toast. BRIDGE I know you see me in your sleep One eye open, trying not to breathe. I know you see me in your sleep One eye open, trying not to breathe.
