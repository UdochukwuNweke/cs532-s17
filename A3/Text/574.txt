the Obamas aren&#8217;t done with politics. 
The 18-year-old daughter of recent President Obama was praised by fellow protester, Shailene Woodley, who also attended the event at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. 
&#8220;It was amazing to see Malia,&#8221; the actress told Democracy Now . 
&#8220;To witness a human being and a woman coming in to her own outside of her family and outside of the attachments that this country has on her, but someone who&#8217;s willing to participate in democracy because she chooses to,&#8221; Woodley said. &#8220;Because she recognizes, regardless of her last name, that if she doesn&#8217;t participate in democracy, there will be no world for her future children.&#8221;

Malia left her family&#8217;s Caribbean vacation to attend the festival, before starting her internship for producer Harvey Weinstein in February, according to the New York Daily News . 
Woodley has been a mainstay at the protests, even getting arrested at one point. 
I&#8217;d like to see someone try arresting Malia with her Secret Service detail standing there. 
The proposed pipeline would cross a river near Native American land and opposition is concerned it could contaminate the drinking water and damage Native American cultural sites. 
President Obama halted the project until an alternate route could be found. Earlier this week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing the construction to move forward as originally planned.
