Conway: When will reporters who &#039;talked smack&#039; be fired?

Kellyanne Conway in an interview Sunday slammed the media, asking when network reporters will be fired over their coverage of the Trump administration. "Who is cleaning house? Which one is going to be the first network to get rid of these people, the people who think things were just not true?" Conway asked on "Fox News Sunday." Conway, a key adviser to President Trump, criticized networks for their coverage of her "alternative facts" statement one week ago, noting that there were other things she said in Sunday show interviews that could have been the reporters' focus. "I went on three network shows and spoke for 35 minutes on three network Sunday shows. You know what got picked? The fact that I said 'alternative facts,' not the fact that I ripped a new one to some of those hosts that they never cover the facts that matter," Conway said.  ADVERTISEMENT "Not one network person has been let go. Not one silly political analyst and pundit who talked smack all day long about Donald Trump  Donald Trump Pentagon Papers whistleblower: Leaks ‘can make a difference’ Cummings: Not clear if Trump ‘knew what the CBC was’ Ana Navarro hits Kushner for complaining about CNN: 'Oh, baby boy, I'm so sorry' MORE  has been let go," she added. "I'm too polite to mention their names, but they know who they are, and they are all wondering who will be the first to go. The election was three months ago. None of them have been let go." Conway and the Trump administration have been in an ongoing feud with the media for months. Trump on Saturday and Sunday attacked The New York Times and The Washington Post in tweets . The Times hit back Saturday, saying that, contrary to Trump's tweets, the publication is seeing more subscriptions and readership.
