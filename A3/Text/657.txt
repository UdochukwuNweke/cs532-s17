COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  The Alabama athletics department self-reported 19 violations for the 2015-16 academic year,  released Friday , with five of them reported against the national champion football team. The violations against the Crimson Tide's football team included a former student-athlete who gave free training sessions to a current athlete and impermissible recruiting decorations; a trophy was left in the area where recruits were hosted. The violations also consisted of impermissible contact with recruits by coaches — both calling and texting. As of April 8, NCAA rules allow for coaches to send unlimited text messages to prospects.   USA TODAY 2016 college football TV schedule   All were secondary violations, which do not generally lead to an NCAA probation, however, an excess of these violations could lead to heightened penalties for severe violations or feed into a notion that an athletic department lacks institutional control. As a result of the violations, the coaches involved will not be allowed to make recruiting calls for two weeks and must wait 30 days before contacting the involved prospect in which the impermissible contact took place with. Alabama defensive line coach Bo Davis left the program in April amid potential recruiting violations . The Tide kick off their season on Sept. 3 against Southern California.
