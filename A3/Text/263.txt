Subscribe to Complex  On Sunday afternoon, Dave Chappelle spoke briefly at a rally in front of Congressman Mike Turner&apos;s office and the federal court building in Dayton, Ohio. The 43-year-old comedian, who converted to Islam in the late 1990s, addressed the crowd through a microphone, saying: &#x201C;We are all here because what you [Trump] are doing does not seem right. As a matter of fact, it sucks. I support refugees, I support immigrants, and I love my friends and neighbors. Thank you.&#x201D;

the amount of hatred and fear radiating from this administration is already hard to bear, but we have to stay informed and stay outraged

I&apos;m thinking of all the Syrian families I met in Iraq last year in the desperate refugee camps and how hopeless it felt. So much worse now.
