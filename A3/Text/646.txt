We reported earlier on how Obama sneakily tried to Western Union nearly a quarter of a billion dollars of your taxpayer money to the Palestinian Authority to fund terrorism against Israel. And he tried to do it just hours before Trump&#8217;s inauguration, so that Congress could do nothing to stop it. 
It looks like Trump ain&#8217;t gonna let Obama run his shenanigans no more. 
From the Business Insider: 
The State Department is reviewing a last-minute decision by former Secretary of State John Kerry to send $221 million dollars to the Palestinians late last week over the objections of congressional Republicans. 
The department said Tuesday it would look at the payment, one of the Obama administration&#8217;s final acts in office, and might make adjustments to ensure it comports with the Trump administration&#8217;s priorities. 
BOOM! I doubt very much that funneling money to terrorist sympathizers who will use it to attack our ally Israel doesn&#8217;t comport with United States policies&#8230; at least, not anymore anyway. 
Representative Kay Granger of Texas, who was one of the lawmakers who first put a hold on the money originally, released a statement slamming Obama for ignoring Congress in the decision: 
&#8220;I am deeply disappointed that President Obama defied congressional oversight and released $221 million to the Palestinian territories.&#8221; 
&#8220;I worked to make sure that no American taxpayer dollars would fund the Palestinian Authority unless very strict conditions were met. While none of these funds will go to the Palestinian Authority because of those conditions, they will go to programs in the Palestinian territories that were still under review by Congress. The Obama Administration&#8217;s decision to release these funds was inappropriate.&#8221; 
It sounds like some of the money might be released eventually, but I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;s in better hands being monitored by the Trump administration with Tillerson as State Secretary, than it would be under Obama and horseface John Kerry.
