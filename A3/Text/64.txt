jhorton (Trailer Park on Cape Cod) Posted: Oct 29, 2016 - 15:09  Everyone in my trailer park thinks this track is dreamy. I'll bet it sounds even better if you live in one of them states where weed is legal.

Mali Music is based on the recordings made by Damon Albarn on an Oxfam-organised trip to Mali a couple of years ago. Rather than take the usual rushed celebrity approach, the Blur and Gorillaz man stayed for a few weeks and with his melodica in hand, played wherever he could (clubs gigs, village jams, on riverboats and in musicians' compounds) with anyone who would let him join in: Toumani Diabate, Lobi Traore and Kasse Mady to name but a few. The tapes were taken back to his West London studio, things were mixed and added and then it was back to Mali for further additions from the excellent Afel Bocoum. Perhaps surprisingly, this doesn't result in a self-indulgent mess. Albarn is clearly motivated by a love of Malian music but he's not afraid to mess with it when he feels the need. So that while some tracks (the self explanatory 4am At Toumani's for example) are pretty much unmucked around with, others feature twangy guitars, muted synth lines or the deep dubby bass of Junior Dan. Apparently the aim was to create a musical travelogue of Mali, but it's one filtered through a particular laid-back West London sensibility. Albarn mainly contents himself with orchestrating the whole thing and playing simple melodica melodies, with just the occasional understated vocal thrown in. The decision to involve Bocoum is a definite plus and all in all, Mali Music is pulled off with just the right mix of respect and inventiveness. &mdash;Jamie Renton As for the track. I believe it is about a . . . spoon   Thank you for this Squid! I was almost getting sleepy and not sure where to place consideration for this : )

haretic (toward Abad, just south of Maitri) Posted: Oct 26, 2012 - 11:43  Hmm. I will have to reconsider the subject of "spoons." I suppose they really are quite unique. Very different from, say, forks. And a world apart from, let us say for example, pebbles. Hey, pass that over to me, will you?

DaveInVA (In a hovel in effluent Damnville, VA) Posted: Sep 05, 2010 - 10:06  I like it also kinda creepy carnival sounding..,  
iw3gtf  Posted: Jul 03, 2010 - 12:59  I like this one, and I don't think I'm in the minority (but I don't even mind, by the way) .

giacondadevito (Singapore) Posted: Feb 16, 2005 - 17:28  Michael Nyman always suxxx...so what do you expect? Tranquilizer music!

saturnine (Turku, Finland) Posted: Jan 03, 2005 - 12:41  Usually when people accuse a song of being "boring", I completely disagree.
But this time I have to say that this song really _was_ utterly boring and it felt like it was going nowhere. Maybe it needs another listen..

Angloray (Los Angeles) Posted: Oct 21, 2004 - 15:17  ewww, I hate seeing my weak-willed defense of Damon Albarn. It's not true at all!!! He's written many many great songs (with witty lyrics) on some of the newer albums too. This just isn't one of them (although I do find it nice as background music).

my thought exactly

not entirely true...there are a lot of great Blur songs out there (yes, some of them are on the older albums, but still...) 
Pyro (Between a rock and a hard place) Posted: Jul 12, 2004 - 07:31  Background music for work. Nice, but not an attention getter. 
saturdays  Posted: Jul 12, 2004 - 07:31  There's really no need to continue to play this song.

Might be the drunken frenchman playing the accordian in it.

pdhski (NY Metro) Posted: Dec 22, 2003 - 11:31  sort of David Sylvian like - but I still don't know if that is a good thing...

There is no mention on AMG, however, Damon Albarn is the lead singer of Blur.
