General: IS Recruits Could Enter U.S. Via Caribbean 
3/13/2015 
Reprints 
War On Terror: The head of U.S. Southern Command has warned lawmakers that IS is radicalizing converts and other Muslims in Latin America and could train and send them north via human traffickers. 
Gen. John Kelly issued his warning in a hearing Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on defense appropriations for fiscal 2016. 
He's concerned that in addition to the Iranian terrorist puppet Hezbollah being active in Latin America, the Islamic State is promoting and recruiting for jihad against the United States in the region. 
"Last year, IS adherents posted discussions on social media calling for the infiltration of the U.S. southern border," Kelly told lawmakers. 
He added that while no evidence of IS recruits using this entry route has been seen thus far, he was "deeply concerned that smuggling networks are a vulnerability that terrorists could seek to exploit." 
So why would IS, with so many of its trainees possessing Western passports, seek to use "coyotes" to transport their minions into the U.S.? Not every IS trainee has a passport, and tracking those who enter the U.S. to do us harm is less likely if they hide among the flood of "immigrants" the Obama administration is openly encouraging. 
The war in Syria has thus far attracted roughly 100 foreign fighters from the Caribbean who could easily make their way here, Kelly said. A hundred might not seem like a lot until we remember just 19 Muslims brought down the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon, killing 3,000, on Sept. 11, 2001. 
What makes Kelly's words resonate is confirmation from the FBI that IS is indeed already walking our streets. "We have active investigations of people in various stages of radicalizing in all 50 states," FBI Director James Comey told the National Association of Attorneys General recently. 
This isn't a New York or Washington phenomenon. This is in all 50 states and in ways that are very hard to see. 
We already see pockets of potential recruits in places such as "Little Mogadishu" in Minneapolis. Fox affiliate KMSP-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul has reported the case of Abdirahmaan Muhumed. 
Before going to Syria to fight and die for IS, he worked at Delta Global Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. His job was to clean aircraft, and he had a security clearance that gave him unfettered access to the tarmac and passenger jets. 
Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old Floridian, managed to return home for a time without U.S. authorities noticing, before returning to Syria and carrying out a massive suicide truck bombing. From the grave, he's recruiting other Americans to join the jihad in a widely distributed martyrdom video. 
"Sunni extremists, while small in number, are actively involved in the radicalization of converts and other Muslims in the region and also provide financial and logistical support to designated terrorist organizations within and outside Latin America," Kelly told the panel. 
Kelly also expressed his concern that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah continues to exploit and expand its penetration of the region. 
Kelly noted that Iran has established 80 "cultural centers" in the area, ostensibly to promote Iran's image and Shi'a Islam. 
But as we have found, they can be recruiting centers for radicalized terrorists. 
Last year, as we noted then, Kelly used the term "existential threat" to describe the influx of people from countries that harbor terrorists, as well as violent transnational gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which specializes in extortion and human trafficking and has criminal franchises throughout the U.S. 
We concur. They're coming to kill us, and some are already here or on their way via our porous southern border.
