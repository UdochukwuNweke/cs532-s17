Luke Kennard continues hot shooting, lifts Duke past Florida   Here's a transcribed excerpt pertaining to Franklin and hoops in Ohio: Gardner: "Do you feel Ohio is still kind of an underrated state as far as producing basketball talent? ... What do you think about the state of Ohio basketball?" Kennard: "I think Ohio is a really, really big basketball state. I think, like you said, it's produced so many great players. It's the state from where LeBron is - the best player in the world. Yeah, I think it's a really big basketball state. I think I've gotten better from playing competition in Ohio. I know the high school I went to, the division that we were in was a big division. We were Div. II, and there was a lot of good teams. I remember playing against guys that were going to play Div. I college basketball. Again, I thought it helped me a lot playing in Ohio. Gardner: "What's the deal with A&amp;G Pizza? It seemed like after every game you were going there. Their Facebook page is like a shrine to you. They don't say come and watch Duke basketball, they say come and watch Luke this weekend as if the Blue Devils are a secondary concern." Kennard: "That's the spot in Franklin. That's the spot to hang out, watch games, get some good pizza. It's a family environment there. Franklin - it's a small town. It's the kind of thing where everybody knows everybody. Everybody knows what's going on. After Friday night football games, after Friday night basketball games, that was the spot to be. Franklin is a great town. People from back home, they support me. I've heard they stream the games there. I know every time I go back home to visit, I have to visit there and see the people there. I know there's gonna be a lot of people from the town that go there and eat and watch games. It's just good to see people like that and know that they support me." Kennard was Associated Press Mr. Basketball in Ohio his junior and senior years at Franklin.
