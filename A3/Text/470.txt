The Windsor Express take on the Island Storm in game six of the NBL Canada finals. April 15, 2014. 
Express Drop a Close One at Cape Breton 103-100 
By Mark Brown January 29, 2017 5:16pm @markbrownradio    Five Windsor Express players had double-digit point totals, but it was not enough to get past the Cape Breton Highlanders Sunday afternoon. 
The Express fell to 4-9 with their 103-100 loss to the Highlanders in Sydney, NS.  Quinnel Brown led the Express with 21 points and DeAndre Thomas sunk an additional 20.  Both led the Express with six rebounds. 
Warren Ward added 19 points for Windsor while Clinton Springer scored 14 points off the bench. 
Shaquille Keith led the Higlanders with 27 points, including seven-for-ten points in free throwing.  Booker Woodfox and Charles Mann Jr. each had 17 points.  Michael Rostampour led Cape Breton defensively with eight rebounds. 
Cape Breton controlled the first half of the game in front of their home crowd, and had a 55-46 lead over the Express at halftime.  The Express tried a comeback attempt, especially in the fourth quarter.  Windsor tied the game up at 97-all with over a minute left to play but were unable to pull ahead. 
The Express return to the WFCU Centre Wednesday night when they are visited by the Orangeville A&#8217;s.
