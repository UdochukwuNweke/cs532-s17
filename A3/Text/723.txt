Facing one of the best teams in the country, No. 20 Oklahoma (16-5, 7-2 Big 12) is currently trailing No. 2 Baylor (20-1, 9-0 Big 12) at halftime, 45-32. 
After winning back-to-back game against Oklahoma State and Iowa State, the Sooners are playing their toughest competition of the season against Baylor. Oklahoma started well, leading the Lady Bears 20-15 after the first quarter. Baylor then started the second quarter on a 15-0 run, giving them a 45-32 lead at the half. 
Leading the way for the Sooners was junior Gabbi Ortiz who recorded nine points and four rebounds. As a team, Oklahoma struggled from the field shooting just 30.6 percent. 
Baylor dominated the paint, out rebounding the Sooners 27-16. The Lady Bears also shot the ball extremely, shooting over 48 percent from the field. 
The Sooners will need a big second half to pull off the upset against No. 2 Baylor.
