Killingly senior Dommoy Ennis winced a bit as he said it. &#x201c;I started playing basketball way too late. I should have started my freshman year,&#x201d; Ennis said. &#x201c;It is what it is.&#x201d; What Ennis is now is a pretty good high school basketball player with just one year of seasoning under his belt. What could have been?. &#x201c;He missed out,&#x201d; Killingly coach Jim Crabtree said with a shake of his head. &#x201c;So did we.&#x201d; Last Monday, the 6-foot-4 center delivered a pretty impressive 17-point, 14-rebound performance against Lyman Memorial. It was his best performance yet in what has been a surprising season. &#x201c;There may be people who won&#x2019;t agree, but Dommoy is the Most Valuable Player of our team right now. Without him, I don&#x2019;t know if we have any wins,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;The other guys might know basketball and look better doing it. Sometimes, Dommoy looks lost if he makes a bad travel or tries to finish a layup, but defensively, what would we do without him? Rebounding, what would we do without him?&#x201d; Crabtree said. Basketball for Ennis was a foreign concept, probably because life for him began in a foreign country. &#x201c;Basketball is not a big thing in Jamaica. It&#x2019;s just track and soccer,&#x201d; Ennis said. He came to the U.S. in the eighth grade with his father. His mother and the rest of his family still live in Jamaica. &#x201c;I like it here. There are more opportunities here than Jamaica. It&#x2019;s harder to get a job and is a harder life down there,&#x201d; Ennis said. He played some basketball in his native land. But when he arrived in the States, he stood just 5-foot-7 and didn&#x2019;t think his guard skills warranted putting too much effort into the game. Ennis decided he wasn&#x2019;t going to play in high school and concentrated on soccer and track as a freshman. But his athletic development, as a whole, was put on hold. A family situation resulted in him being held out of all sports in his sophomore year. In the meantime, he grew. He sprouted up to about 6-foot-2 as a sophomore and has since tacked on a couple additional inches. He has the genes for it. His father may only stand 5-11, but his mom is 6-2 and his grandmother is 6-1. With his newfound height, he gave basketball another shot last year. Following his junior year, spent mostly on the bench, he played some AAU ball and summer league with his Killingly teammates. He and point guard Jared Gosper were also frequent visitors to the basketball courts at the Prince Hill Park in Brooklyn. But the native of St. Catherine, Jamaica, said he didn&#x2019;t really focus on his game until recently. He finally bought into what Crabtree was selling. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always worked hard, but the last three weeks have been amazing,&#x201d; the Killingly coach said. &#x201c;He now realizes that he can be pretty good and have some fun doing this. It was like a secondary thing for him. He was a left-footed kid in soccer, he&#x2019;s strong, he&#x2019;s big, no one wants to run into that body. Now, he&#x2019;s starting to figure out, no one wants to run into him (on the court).&#x201d; Ennis also has a vertical leap as good as anyone Crabtree has coached. It makes him Killingly&#x2019;s best rebounder and a pretty imposing obstacle in the middle for opposing players. But offensively, it&#x2019;s generally still a work in progress. He is a big enough target and dangerous enough offensively that he can open up other opportunities for other players when teams collapse on him. &#x201c;Offensively, we&#x2019;re running everything through him now because we know what we&#x2019;re going to get out of him,&#x201d; Crabtree said. He&#x2019;s not an especially gifted scorer (7.7 points) and his inexperience results in a generally flirtatious relationship with the net. What he puts up, doesn&#x2019;t always come down where it&#x2019;s supposed to. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like shooting. Shooting is not my thing,&#x201d; Ennis said with a smile. &#xa0;
