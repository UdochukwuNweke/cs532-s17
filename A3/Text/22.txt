Green Bay Packers free safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix earned his first Pro Bowl invitation and made second-team All-Pro for the NFL's 2016 season. But the way the former Alabama All-American sees it, he's just getting started. 
"I'm sorry to tell you this, but I'm not even as close to as good as I'm going to get," Clinton-Dix told the Packers' official web site. "Going into my fourth year, I'm telling you, it's going to get a little crazy. ... 
"Since a kid, I've been a top safety coming out of high school, a top safety coming out of college. What's next? I just challenge myself to be compared to one of the best in the league, to an Earl (Thomas) or an Eric Berry and all the great safeties around the league. I just try to compete, and I'm just trying to be the best." 
Clinton-Dix said he watched film with a more critical eye during his third NFL season, looking for plays he could have made. 
"I'd be like 'Dang! I was thinking that, but I didn't do it,' so that's a play I left out there," Clinton-Dix said . "A couple catches I could have caught this year that I didn't make happen. They're still out there. I'm sitting on five (interceptions), but I could have been sitting on eight had I caught all the ones that touched my hand. There's more out there."

Clinton-Dix had hoped to be traveling to Houston on Sunday. But Green Bay lost to the Atlanta Falcons 44-21 last week in the NFL championship game, so they won't be playing in Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium on Feb. 5. 
Instead, Clinton-Dix will be playing for the NFC in the annual Pro Bowl, which kicks off at 7 p.m. CST Sunday in Orlando, Florida. ESPN will televise the game. 
"It's a little different," Clinton-Dix said . "I'm still a little upset about our loss we had last Sunday, so that's still haunting me. But right now, I can kick my feet back and enjoy the moment. ... 
"It's an honor just to be here. It's unbelievable to be around the best of the best in the league. It's a dream come true, and I'm living in it right now." 
The Pro Bowl is a homecoming game for Clinton-Dix, who played at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando. 
"They have been asking me about spots to go to and stuff to do in Orlando," Clinton-Dix said of his fellow all-stars. "So I've been giving them a few places to go to, and I'm just glad to be back home."
