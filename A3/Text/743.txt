New Media Limited creates &quot;dark and cartoony world&quot; for Yeasayer music video 
Music: New York directing collective New Media Limited takes hand-painted clay characters on a Hansel and Gretel-inspired adventure in the music video for Yeasayer's Silly Me track. 
New Media Limited, which is made up of Mike Anderson, Ryan Dickie and Abigail Horton, had previously directed a film for Yeasayer, and were brought on board to create something of the same aesthetic. 
&quot;The only real direction we were given was to link it to I Am Chemistry, our previous video for Yeasayer, so we made it the prequel to that video,&quot; Anderson told Dezeen. &quot;We wanted to do a riff on Hansel and Gretel, both cartoony and very dark.&quot; 
&quot;We'd already made a world in Chemistry, and it was fun to expand on that and the explore the solar system that world was in,&quot; he continued. Related story: Plasticine Tronald Dump creates consumerist hell in Kill the Noise music video Anderson said the team's creative process often results in videos that form an &quot;abstract&quot; representation of the lyrics. 
Throughout the Silly Me video, two main characters ? a boy and a girl ? explore a series of settings and landscapes. 
They begin in a forest, before finding a secret house amongst trees filled with dancing animals. 
The pair begin dancing with the fauna, who are cooking something in a cauldron, before the animals turn on them ? eventually dismembering the boy and throwing him into the cooking pot. 
The girl then dives into the cauldron after the boy, eventually falling out into a parallel universe. Here, she is met by strange dancing creatures who she eventually escapes by boat, which floats on a lake filled with the boy's body parts. 
&quot;As far as the dismemberment goes, I think there's almost a literal interpretation of a relationship falling apart in there,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;When the girl finds the boy again, he's in pieces and impossibly large.&quot; 
&quot;Maybe sometimes that's what a memories of a former lover or lost friend feel...
