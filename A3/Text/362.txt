TYLER, Texas - After an early lead, the East Texas Baptist University men&rsquo;s basketball team could not hang on as they fell to the University of Texas at Tyler 92-78. ETBU falls to 12-7 overall and 4-7 in American Southwest Conference action. UT Tyler improves to 14-6 overall and 8-4 in ASC play. 
ETBU scored the first basket of the game two minutes into the contest, and then held a 6-5 lead over UT Tyler with 14:20 to play in the first half. UT Tyler would respond with a 14-4 run over the next four minutes to push the lead to 18-10. ETBU would bring the score within four points before the final media timeout of the first half, but would not get any closer to the Patriots. UT Tyler led 39-25 at the break. 
The second half was an even match, as both schools scored 53 points in the final frame. ETBU would bring the score as close as 12 points, and saw their deficit stretch as much as 23 points. UT Tyler has now won six games in a row. 
ETBU was led by Dylan Augustine with 17 points, 15 of which came in the second half. Jordan Quillian had 15 points and seven rebounds. Robby Dooley finished with 12 points, and Will Thomas added 10 points. Jordan Gosey had seven rebounds in the game, five from offensive boards. 
ETBU shot 40.0% from the field, 24.0% from behind the arc, and 66.7% from the free throw line. ETBU only turned the ball over nine times in the contest, and brought down 32 rebounds as a team. 
Tyler Jacobs led UT Tyler with 17 points and five rebounds. Jordan Francis had 16 points, Melvin Anthony with 14 points, Josh Tatum had 11 points, and Emeka Obukwelu finished with 10 points. UT Tyler shot 59.6% from the field, 43.8% from behind the arc, and 76.7% from the field.
