COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  STARKVILLE - Texas A&amp;M coach Gary Blair looked to his bench with a facial expression that suggested he just took a sip of the world’s most bitter beer after Victoria Vivians made a wide-open 3-pointer in the second period. In frustration, the 71-year-old then removed his navy blue suit jacket. “Take this,” he told an Aggies staffer. That’s the kind of reaction No. 5 Mississippi State typically prompts from its opponents once it gets on a roll with crisp offensive sets, ball movement and aggressive defense. Such was the case in the second period of MSU’s 71-61 win against Texas A&amp;M at Humphrey Coliseum on Sunday. “The second quarter was big,” said MSU coach Vic Schaefer. “I told them at the end of that first quarter and giving up 20 points that we were on pace to give up 80 and we needed to do something different.” The defense certainly tightened up and MSU was 9-for-17 in the period. Vivians’ trey, the one that made Blair lose his jacket, gave MSU a 29-25 lead with 4:55 left in the first half as it outscored Texas A&amp;M 26-9 in the second quarter. From there, the Bulldogs (21-1, 7-1 SEC) coasted until Texas A&amp;M (15-6, 5-3) made a brief run in the fourth . Vivians led MSU with 18 points but was not on the court during Texas A&amp;M’s 6-0 run to start the fourth period when the Bulldogs’ lead was trimmed to 55-50 with 6:31 left. Schaefer said leaving Vivians, who returned late in the period, on the bench was a result of how well his other wing players played. With Vivians on the bench, MSU still was able to pull away, which speaks to the team’s depth. Chinwe Okorie made a layup after a timeout that made it 57-50. “It is very unusual because it hard to keep continuity with substitutions,” Schaefer said. “The beauty of this team is that we do have this depth. We are far from a finished product, but we sure do have a chance.” After Okorie’s defensive rebound on the ensuing possession, Roshunda Johnson hit a layup that made it 62-52. Johnson had nine points in 13 minutes off the bench. “She was special for us,” Schaefer said. “She is coming and I have been saying that for a while.” Johnson wasn’t alone in that regard. Nine MSU players logged more than 10 minutes each against a team that is just outside the top 25. Morgan William added 10 points and nine assists, and Okorie finished with nine points and nine rebounds. Schaefer said he has never been part of a team with as much depth as MSU has. After the game, Blair congratulated MSU for its atmosphere, adding that the Bulldogs have become a special program under Schaefer. That much was clear, as nearly 8,000 watched the Bulldogs bounce back from its loss against No. 4 South Carolina . “My concern was on Texas A&amp;M,” Schaefer said. “If our players can’t get up for 7,700 fans at home to support them, we need to check our pulse.” Contact Will Sammon at 601-961-7091 or wsammon@gannett.com .
