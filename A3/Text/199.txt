Published on Oct 21, 2015 New album coming Spring 2016. iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mot ... GERMANY: https://vimeo.com/154749525 Audio - Mixed & Mastered by Joshua Wickman (Dreadcore Productions) Video - Produced by Pavels Trebukhin (Tre Productions) Distributed by WMG Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to grey? Will all I ever say be more than just a copy? Or am I living in a world stuck on repeat? I know, I should find comfort in similarities. But instead it's draining me of any creativity. And now I fear we're merely tracing outlines left by others overtime. I've been on the search for reason. Looking to make sense of my life while breaking down true meaning. Will all I ever say be more than just a copy? Or am I living in a world stuck on repeat? How many times, (How many times) can we use the same old played out lines? (Sever the ties, Open your eyes) I've heard this shit a thousand times. I know I'm guilty and so I'll still be searching for my way out of this maze. Do I have nothing new to add? Do I have nothing left to offer? The scary part of it all is that everything I'm saying has been said before. So say your line and move along, move along. I've been so scared of getting older. Pushing 27 now with nothing to show for the time spent and dedication. Spilling out my guts onto this piece of paper. Yea. Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to gray? Will I ever be anything more than a fucking copy? Will I ever be anything, anything at all. Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to gray?
