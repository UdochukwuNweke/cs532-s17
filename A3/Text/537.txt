INDIANAPOLIS &ndash; James Harden got loose for a floater in the lane with no Pacers defender close enough to distract his view of the rim a few feet away. He had missed just about every variety of shot in his repertoire, but had not tried one of those. 
When he clanged that, too, he gave Pacers center Myles Turner a shove and left the game, exchanging pained smiles with Pat Beverley as if they knew if that shot would not go, nothing could go right. 
Harden had seemed to empty the tank in Philadelphia, leaving little for the Pacers. With the Rockets around him and their struggling defense unable to make up the difference, the Pacers rolled easily, 120-101, sending the Rockets home after a 2-3 road trip and looking like a team running on fumes and needing a revival. 
A game after Harden's 51-point triple-double to hold off the 76ers, he made 3 of 17 shots with as many turnovers (8) as assists. Ryan Anderson led the Rockets with 27 points, making 5 of 8 3s. But the rest of the Rockets made just 6 of 31 3s, including the pair that Bobby Brown tossed in with the benches cleared for the final 2 &frac12; minutes. 
Paul George led the Pacers with 33 points and led Indiana's aggressive, overplaying perimeter defense. But after the initial minutes when the Rockets struggled to get free, mostly Harden and the Rockets just missed the shots they want, making 34 of 83 (41.5 percent) only with the flurry in the last minutes. 
The Rockets came out misfiring, which was not unusual and was likely to be expected in the final game of a long road trip. But to keep it tight under those circumstances, they would have to defend well enough to make the game a relatively low-scoring struggle. 
Instead, the Pacers moved into the lane easily, getting good shots and piling up an 18-point lead early in the second quarter. 
While the Rockets made just 6 of 22 shots in the first quarter, matching their worst shooting opening quarter of the season, the Pacers made 66.7 percent, taking a 33-20 lead with Harden not getting on the scoreboard until he had a three-point play on a backdoor cut in the final minute of the quartrer. 
When the Pacers made 4 of 5 shots to start the second quarter, with Al Jefferson and Lavoy Allen moving in the paint as easily as Thaddeus Young and Miles Turner had, the Pacers led 42-24 just 2 &frac12; minutes into the second quarter. 
The Rockets' defense tightened and the Pacers cooled off. With the Pacers making 2 of their next 12 shots, the Rockets closed to within six. Eric Gordon and Clint Capela gave the Rockets a much-needed lift off the bench. They seemed back in the game with plenty of time left. 
The Rockets, however, did not make a shot in the final three minutes of the half, with Anderson, Ariza and Harden (twice) missing 3s and the Pacers ended the half on an 8-0 run. 
The Rockets never recovered, clanging 3s and not getting anywhere near enough stops to make a run while dragging their offense behind them.
