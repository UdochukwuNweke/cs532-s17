COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  The Louisville football team lost a commitment Sunday night from three-star Nashville defensive tackle Ben Hutch, who flipped his pledge to Cincinnati after an official visit there. The 6-foot-3, 315-pound Hutch committed to U of L last month over Texas A&amp;M and Penn State and was seen as a key recruit for the Cards at the time. Without Hutch, U of L has 21 pledges in the 2017 class with national signing day coming on Wednesday.
