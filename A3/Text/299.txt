Hurricane Matthew couldn’t have come at a worse time for high school swimmers statewide. Not only did the tropical cyclone delay the state meet in Columbia by a week, but more importantly took swimmers out of their respective comfort zones. For those on the Grand Strand, schools were closed for nearly two weeks, thus postponing all athletic and extracurricular events. Unable to compete or practice, the onus was on swimmers during that stretch to stay in shape. “It was sort of hard,” said Myrtle Beach swimmer Olivia McGonigal. “Not being allowed to practice because school was out, it was my responsibility to do so and push myself.” A veteran swimmer on the competitive circuit, her regimen would prove to be enough at October’s Class 4A swim meet. Competing in the 100-yard backstroke event, McGonigal was able to tap the wall first (1:00.07), claiming a state title just ahead of St. James’ Kater Wolff — who just happens to one of her best friends. “It was awesome having (Wolff) finish second and me getting first,” she said. “It was pretty cool, because we went in seeded first and second. To finish that way, that’s all we could’ve asked for.” The title would be the only one earned by a girls swimmer on the Grand Strand. Add another title to McGonigal’s name, with the Myrtle Beach sophomore earning The Sun News’ Toast of the Coast Girls Swimmer of the Year honor. “It is really awesome, truly an honor,” she said. “You practice about five days a week, sometimes two times a day for a season that last two months. I worked really hard to get that far.” McGonigal also was second and third in the 200-yard medley and freestyle relay teams, respectively, in addition to a seventh-place result in the 200-yard freestyle event at the state meet. She also earned a Region VII-4A title in three events. According to Myrtle Beach swim coach Michael Angwin, it was a season in which she raised the bar for herself, as well as her team. “Olivia had a spectacular season,” he said. “Won most of her events this year, crushed the region meet as well as a strong showing at the state meet. For a coach, (McGonigal) dedicated herself to swimming, came to every practice, competed in every meet. “The best female swimmer on our team this year.” For all the individual accolades, though, McGonigal admits the common bond held among teammates — among them her brother, Sean, on the Seahawks boys swim squad — is what made the season that much sweeter. “I love my team, can’t say enough about them,” she said. “It’s special having your brother in the same sport you are. Though he does different events, it is pretty nice having someone who feels your pain in certain circumstances.” Joe L.
