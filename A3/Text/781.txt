00:27 - 01:51 (pin-1)   Intro - 50 hr seminars - Why here? Not to motivate, he is the why guy. Emotion is the force of life. We can all think, rationalize.

">  03:57 - 05:05 (pin-5)   Question - what is it that shapes us? Some people have all the resources and some don't and yet achieve the most. Some live in the mindset that we are out past.

If decisions shape destiny there are 3 decisions we are making every moment of our lives. What am I going to focus on? (Focus = feeling) What does it mean? (Is it the end of the beginning? Are you being punished or rewarded?) What are you going to do? (are you going to give up or move forward?) Decisions can shape our culture. Emotional fitness, physiological strength is what is the difference. ">  09:49 - 10:55 (pin-8)   So what shapes you? 2 invisible forces that shape us: State (physical/emotional) Long term (our model of the world/world view). This is the filter. To influence someone we need know what already influences them. 3 parts: What is you target? (there are 6 human needs) What's the belief system to get those needs? Fuel you pick. ">  10:58 - 13:24 (pin-9)   Six human needs: Certainty Uncertainty (we need variety) Feel significant (fastest way is violence) Connection and love  ">  13:25 - 14:26 (pin-10)   First 4 are the needs of the personality -everyone meets (will not get fulfillment from these). Last 2 are the needs of the spirit - this is where you get fulfillment Grow To contribute beyond ourselves (life is about we and not me)  ">  14:27 - 16:03 (pin-11)   11 years old thanksgiving - father made 3 decisions (most painful experience). His decisions shaped him - strangers care and I care about them and I will make a difference. Got friends involved and fed 2 million people. ">  16:05 - 18:05 (pin-12)   Whatever your lead system is it tilts you in difference directions. We are all trying to meet the same needs of significance but they have a different map. If you have a target and map (to get there), the last thing is Emotion. There are 6000 emotions we have words for. Most people experience less than 12 and 1/2 make them feel bad. ">  18:05 - 19:47 (pin-13)   9/11 in Hawaii - When do people really start living? - When they face death.
