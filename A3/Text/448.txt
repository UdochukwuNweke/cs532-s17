The Writers Guild of America has blasted President Donald Trump &#8217;s ban on refugees and citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries from entering the United States. 
&#8220;It is both unconstitutional and deeply wrong to say that you cannot enter our country because of where you were born or what religion you were born into,&#8221; said WGA West president Howard Rodman and WGA East president Michael Winship in a statement on Sunday. 
&#8220;The Writers Guilds of America, East and West condemn Donald Trump’s profoundly un-American &#8216;Muslim ban,&#8217; and applaud the Federal Court’s decision to grant a stay that will keep those being held at American airports from being forcibly returned to their countries. Human rights – including the freedoms of speech and religion – are essential to all Americans and to all who come here to build better lives.&#8221;

Trump signed the executive order on Friday to suspend entry of refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, and imposed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. A 90-day ban was also placed on citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. 
Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose movie &#8220;The Salesman&#8221; is nominated for the foreign-language-film Oscar, issued a statement Sunday saying he will not attend   the Oscars even if exceptions are made to allow him entry to the U.S. Rodman and Winship said it&#8217;s wrong that Farhadi might not be allowed into the U.S. 
&#8220;We are especially troubled by reports that Asghar Farhadi, director of &#8216;The Salesman,&#8217; which won Best Screenplay at Cannes and is now nominated for an Oscar, may together with his cast and crew be prevented from entering our country,&#8221; they said. &#8220;From its early days, the entertainment industry has been built by the imagination of immigrants. Our guilds are unions of storytellers who have always welcomed those from other nations, and of varying beliefs, who wish to share their creativity with America. We are grateful to them, we stand with them, we will fight for them.&#8221;

For those of you who have no idea what the constitution says about this, let me enlighten you: 
1) First, Trump&#8217;s Order is NOT a Muslim. Now that you understand this, 
2) Know also that the U.S. Constitution does NOT grant anyone the right to move to, visit or live in the United States. Therefore, the order CANNOT be unconstitutional as this article claims &#8230; PERIOD.

On Sept. 11, 2001, 19 militants hijacked four commercial airlines to carry out terrorist attacks on the U.S. that killed 2,996 people and wounded more than 6,000 others. The 19 men were associated with al-Qaeda, a decentralized terrorist network, at the time led by Osama bin Laden. 
Of the 19 hijackers, 15 were from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Egypt and one from Lebanon. 
All countries he gave a free pass. He just happens to have business dealings with those countries. Coincidence?

This has nothing to do with religion. There is no muslim ban. It is seven countries identified by the Obama administration that has deep ties to training and harboring terrorists. Until we can properly vet them, they should not come in. I don&#8217;t see the problem here.

Ya know, we really don&#8217;t care what the writers, actors, or any other guild has to say about our country. You are not in charge of anything remotely important, you make garbage up, fiction, fantasy. President Trump was elected by the same people who go to the movies, buy your products, you better watch what you are doing, they will turn on you! America believes in President Trump, and backs his orders, all of them. He&#8217;s doing a fine job!
