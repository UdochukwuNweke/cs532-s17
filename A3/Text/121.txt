SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER      Supporters of President Trump have helped raise nearly $24,000 for a limo owned by a Muslim immigrant after it was set on fire and destroyed by left-wing protesters during the inauguration riots . 
The GoFundMe page for Nationwide Chauffeured Limo Service  recently reached just under $24,000 in donations, most of which have come from conservatives and other limo service workers, after one of the company&#8217;s limos was attacked by a mob of protesters and completely damaged on inauguration day.

The limo, which was owned by Muslim immigrant Muhammad Ashraf, was attacked with bricks and rocks after dropping off a customer, before the vehicle was completely torched&#8211; leaving the driver with minor injuries. 
&#8220;Protesters don&#8217;t understand that they are putting innocent people out of business with their actions. I hope you get enough here to replace your limo so that you can continue your small business,&#8221; commented one user who donated $25, before tagging Trump&#8217;s signature slogan &#8220;#MAGA.&#8221; 
&#8220;Showing the Left what tolerance looks like,&#8221; commented another with his $25 donation, while one $50 donation was signed &#8220;From a Trump Supporter.&#8221; 
Ashraf, who did not support President Trump during the election, expressed disappointed in the protesters who torched his limousine . 
“I did not agree with many of the things he said, but that still does not give me the right to go and affect someone’s livelihood,” he said . “I really don’t think we need to take this [violent] route.” 
Though nearly $24,000 has been raised, the damage to Ashraf&#8217;s vehicle is reported to cost around $70,000 , which does not include the medical expenses and commission for the driver who was attacked.
