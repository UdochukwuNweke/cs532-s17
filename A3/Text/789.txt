Obaloluwa Moses Martins a.k.a  Oba Marteenz   is a young talented Nigerian Afro gospel artiste who is currently living in the UK with his family. He started music at an early age with poetry recitations and performances in Zaria, Kaduna state – Nigeria. He relocated to Lagos State- Nigeria to satisfy his quest for musical excellence and berthed at the camp of the award winning music producer Puffy T. For Oba Marteenz, living in the UK has been one of the greatest change he experienced; adapting to the weather,studying, working and starting a family of his own. But, all these couldn’t stop him from pursuing his dream of impacting younger generations and the whole world with his good music. 
The song was endorsed by   @djgosporella
