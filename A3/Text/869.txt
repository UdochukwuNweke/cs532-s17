Our hearts broke when Stranger Things failed to do justice to Barb, our favorite nerdy side character. 
But never fear: Your girl Barb — aka actress Shannon Purser — is back and looking great on the Screen Actors Guild Awards red carpet.

Despite her relatively minor part on the Netflix sci-fi drama, fans took a liking to Barb and were saddened by her quick demise. As David Harbour, who plays Police Chief Jim Hopper, told a crowd at New York Comic Con in October, though Barb is definitely dead, fans can expect some justice for the character.

The Netflix sci-fi drama is nominated for a Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, while stars Millie Bobby Brown and Wynona Ryder are both up for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series.

Naturally, the kid cast of Stranger Things hit the red carpet looking as adorable as usual.
