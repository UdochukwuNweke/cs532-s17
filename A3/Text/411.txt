Celebrities are encouraging people to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union, and some are matching donations from fans, after the nonprofit organization issued a legal challenge to President Donald Trump 's executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Sia, Rosie O'Donnell and Judd Apatow each announced on Twitter that they will match donations up to $100,000 to "help our queer & immigrant friends," as Sia put it.
Musician Jack Antonoff said he will be matching donations up to $20,000. He encouraged his followers to "stand with me for immigrants and the LGBTQ community."

After Trump on Friday called for an immediate 90-day suspension of immigration from Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya for ties to terrorism, along with suspending indefinitely the acceptance of Syrian refugees, the ACLU issued a legal challenge in a Brooklyn federal court.
The court granted an emergency stay of the order Saturday night.
After that decision, the Department of Homeland Security said in a press release that it "will continue to enforce all of the president's executive orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people."
The statement said that Trump's executive orders remain "in place," despite the emergency stay.
Other celebrities encouraged others to donate to the ACLU to support its efforts.
