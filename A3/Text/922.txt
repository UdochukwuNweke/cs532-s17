Shed the Music 	
Jan 29 
Posted by choirguy 
While at the Illinois Music Education Conference, two band teachers introduced themselves and their work.  They have created a website called The Shed , or  Shed the Music , a resource that is currently free that features videos about music theory. 
While it is wonderful to have resources such as musictheory.net  and teoria.com , additional resources in this space are always welcome, and as such, please check out shedthemusic.com !

&#8220;Our Hearts Sing.&#8221; 			 “Technology alone is not enough. [It is] technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing” 
--Steve Jobs, iPad 2 Introduction, March 2, 2011
