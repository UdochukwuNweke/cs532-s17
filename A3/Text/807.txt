Donald Trump&#8217;s Muslim Ban is being condemned far and wide. American hero and former NFL player Pat Tillman&#8217;s widow Marie took to Facebook to blast the president and the controversial ban. 
Tillman left behind millions in the NFL to serve his country as a member of the Army Rangers after the 9/11 attacks. He was killed while in service in Afghanistan in 2004. While Trump is selling the ban on Muslim immigration as a precaution to preserve the nation&#8217;s safety, a number of servicemen and women have spoken against it.
