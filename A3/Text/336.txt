CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  With the arrival of conference competition, one can usually expect the upset volume in college basketball to get dialed up a notch or two. Even still, the shock value of results over the past week was, at the very least, above average. When the dust settled, 10 teams ranked No. 13 or better in the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll, including seven of the top 10, tasted defeat at least once since last Monday. Some of those losses came at the hands of other highly rated teams, of course, but the rankings will nevertheless look considerably different this week. One team that did not lose was unbeaten Gonzaga, No. 3 last week. Could the Bulldogs (22-0) move up to No. 1? Naturally, the season goes on, with a lot more potential for upheaval as the calendar turns to February. Here are some items of interest over the next few days. Game to watch No. 5 Baylor at No. 1 Kansas, Wednesday, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN2 The numbers will almost certainly be altered, but both these teams should still be in the top five when they take the floor in legendary Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks will probably fall behind Gonzaga, the last unbeaten squad in Division I and one of the few upper-tier members to avoid the recent upset bug. MORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL  Kansas freshman Josh Jackson asserts himself more and more    Bronson Koenig becomes Native American role model he never had    Surprising rise for Josh Pastner, Georgia Tech    No. 3 Gonzaga rolls past Pepperdine, could be bumped up to top ranking   But KU was able to get a split of last week’s pair of challenging road contests, thanks to Saturday’s triumph at Kentucky, and could retain a number of first-place votes. The Bears also got through the week unscathed, though they needed a big second-half rally to prevail in their Big 12/SEC Challenge matchup at Ole Miss. The Jayhawks feature one of the nation’s best back-court combinations, but Baylor’s Johnathan Motley might be able to take advantage of KU’s short-handed interior. Player to watch: Evan Bradds, Belmont The reigning Ohio Valley Conference player of the year, the Bruins’ sharp-shooting 6-7 forward could be a name to know once March Madness rolls around. Bradds is averaging a league-best 20.9 points per game along with 8.7 rebounds. Just how good is his shot? He’s hitting at a clip of above 60% from the field, more than 80% from the free-throw line and better than 50% from three-point range. You can catch him in action Thursday night in a clash of OVC division leaders as Belmont visits Murray State (9 p.m. ET, ESPNU).  No. 3 Gonzaga rolls past Pepperdine, could be bumped up to top ranking    No. 2 Villanova edges No. 13 Virginia with a tip-in at the buzzer    Manu Lacomte paces No. 5 Baylor in rally over Ole Miss   Conference to watch: Atlantic Coast If ACC fans have learned anything over the years, it’s that nothing is ever easy. Duke made a tough stretch a little better thanks to Saturday’s buzzer beater at Wake Forest, but they face a quick turnaround having to play at Notre Dame on Monday (7 p.m. ET, ESPN). The Fighting Irish, who dropped a pair of games last week, won’t be terribly sympathetic to the Blue Devils’ issues. Miami (Fla.), which pulled off one of the biggest surprises on Saturday taking down North Carolina, will try for another upset Wednesday when the Hurricanes host archrival Florida State, but the Seminoles are in need of a bounce-back win of their own. As fate would have it, the ACC team that gets a few days off probably doesn’t want them. Louisville posted decisive wins in its last two outings but is off until Saturday.
