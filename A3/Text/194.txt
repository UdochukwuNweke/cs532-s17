Published on Mar 4, 2016 March 4, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS Monsieur Periné hails from Colombia, a country known for its Afro-Colombian cumbia, as well as New York-style salsa. Instead, however, the band has embraced 1920s-era, guitar-driven jazz from the U.S. The unlikely inspiration has resulted in a large and international following, as well as a Latin Grammy not too long ago: Monsieur Periné was named 2015's Best New Artist. Words don't do this band justice. Play the video and discover Monsieur Periné's magic for yourself. Caja De Música is available now iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/caj...
