In keeping with his splendid run, B. Adhiban signed off his dream debut in the Tata Steel Masters chess tournament in style by scoring over Hungary’s Richard Rapport in the 13th and final round here on Sunday. After Wesley So (9 points) won his game against Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi in just 28 moves to make sure of the title, Adhiban also won with black in 41 moves to top a three-way tie for the third spot with 7.5 points. However, P. Hari Krishna lost to last-placed Loek van Wely. Hari tied for the ninth spot with six points. With Levon Aronian and Wei Yi losing and staying at 7.5 points, Magnus Carlsen’s draw against Sergey Karjakin was enough to give him the runner-up spot with eight points. 
The results: 13th round: 
Richard Rapport (Hun, 4.5) lost to B. Adhiban (7.5); Loek van Wely (Ned, 3.5) bt P. Hari Krishna (6); Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 5) lost to Wesley So (USA, 9); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 8) drew with Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 7); Dmitry Andreikin (Rus, 6) bt Levon Aronian (Arm, 7.5); Wei Yi (Chn, 7.5) lost to Radoslaw Wojtaszek (Pol, 6); Anish Giri (Ned, 6.5) drew with Pavel Eljanov (Ukr, 7).
