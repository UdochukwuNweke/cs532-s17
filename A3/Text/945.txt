Skepta and Adele have been recognised as being among the 500 &#8216;most influential&#8217; people in Britain. 
The list of people, which highlights notable figures from backgrounds ranging from philanthropy to engineering, has been compiled by &#8220;independent specialists&#8221; and experts at Debrett&#8217;s , which has &#8220;identified people of influence in Britain&#8221; for nearly 250 years. All candidates on the list either live or work in the UK, and have been selected &#8220;on the basis of their level of influence over the lives, choices and ideas of others.&#8221; 
In music, Tottenham is represented by its two most famous artists in Skepta and Adele. The two join the likes of Calvin Harris , Little Mix and Ed Sheeran as the leading musicians on the list, while music broadcasting is represented by Lauren Laverne, Radio 1 and 1xtra Head of Music Chris Price and Beats 1 DJ Julie Adenuga &#8211; Skepta&#8217;s sister.
