COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Quarterback Jacob Free has pledged to sign with Vanderbilt on signing day Wednesday, but other schools still are trying to whisk him away for a “secret visit.” Free, a 6-foot-4, 198-pounder from Brantley, Ala., said he’s not taking any such visits to other campuses during this final recruiting weekend, but that hasn’t stopped the invitations from coming. “I got a text message from a school just this morning asking me to visit,” Free said Wednesday, just as Vanderbilt quarterbacks coach Gerry Gdowski arrived at his high school for a visit. Landing the right quarterback can be a ruthless competition in college football recruiting. Teams usually sign only one or perhaps two quarterbacks per recruiting class. The top ones jockey for a scholarship at the right school, and those schools battle for the right quarterback. Free was Vanderbilt’s first commitment in the 2017 class, making his pledge back in June. “You kind of feel like it’s first-come, first-serve, and I wanted that spot before someone else took it,” said Free, rated a three-star prospect by 247Sports, Rivals and Scout. “I knew the full-on recruiting (by other schools) would slow down once I committed, but I also knew it wouldn’t completely stop.”    Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Signing Day 2017: Vanderbilt football signees photos  Fullscreen    Post to Facebook  Posted!

Ashley Kilcrease, his coach at Brantley High, said Free canceled previously scheduled January visits to Purdue and Troy in order to hold true to the Commodores, but some schools still are trying to get him to campus in more low-key ways. When prospective players visit college campuses, it is usually reported by recruiting websites and other media, even though coaches cannot comment publicly about recruits. And the school holding the player’s commitment often finds out that its recruit is considering another school. But at last resort, a school can try to quietly bring in the player on a visit with no recruiting coverage and no mentions by the player on social media. Kilcrease said schools have tried such tactics with Free over the past couple of weeks. “There have been schools trying to get him on a secret visit, just have him come in secretly,” Kilcrease said. “He just told them he’s anchored down (with Vanderbilt).” RELATED  Quarterback Jacob Free commits to Vanderbilt Vanderbilt recruiting class taking shape  Free is ranked as the 24th-best pro-style quarterback in the 2017 class , according to the 247Sports composite rating. Only one quarterback in the top 45 has yet to commit to a school. Free passed for 7,367 yards, 95 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in his high school career. And after committing to Vanderbilt, he had his best season, passing for 2,727 yards, 32 touchdowns and only four picks as a senior. Free is among 15 commitments for Vanderbilt, which is expected to sign 19 or 20 players total. He said different Vanderbilt coaches have visited him every time a recruiting period has opened, just to make sure he’s still on board.  Great visit with Coach Mason! #AnchorDown pic.twitter.com/pMVyIkzyys &mdash; Jacob Free (@jacob_free) January 12, 2017  Gdowski has been to Brantley numerous times. Coach Derek Mason came to Free’s home on Jan. 12. Offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig traveled there on Jan. 18. And Free took his official visit to Vanderbilt last weekend.  Thanks to Coach Ludwig for stopping by today. #AnchorDown pic.twitter.com/Fdg3vQTEMo &mdash; BrantleyFootball (@BrantleyFball) January 18, 2017  “They want me there. That’s obvious because they’ve shown me that every chance they’ve gotten,” Free said. “That’s why I have no interest in going anywhere else but Vanderbilt.” Reach Adam Sparks at asparks@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter @AdamSparks.
