Nerubo (Denver, CO) Posted: Nov 22, 2016 - 15:20  It's almost impossible to be in a bad mood while listening to this song. Nor am I inclined to try.  
ch83575  Posted: Sep 21, 2016 - 09:57  I can't hear Dr. John without thinking about Curious George.  
ziggytrix (Dallas, TX) Posted: Jul 20, 2016 - 08:56  At the end where they're singing "what'd I say" I feel like they're taunting my failures to decipher the accents earlier.

I had thought the grateful dead for some reason but that was probably just the first version i heard.  Sugar Boy Crawford gets credit but most people in New Orleans say its more a traditional song same as wikipedia suggests. Have family there and everybody in family remembers it so go figure and this isn't Mac's best version fo sho I do neaux dat cher

AphidA (Alexandria, VA) Posted: Apr 11, 2006 - 08:21  All versions of this song are rather "ho-hum" I'd say.

Larry Williams (of "Dizzy, Miss Lizzy" fame) recorded a blazing cool version of it in the late 1950's. Williams gets songwriting credit on this fabulous compilation album , but other sources cite James Crawford in 1950. The roots of the song go even further back into folk traditions. 
Maybe some of those versions would be better, because this one really doesn't do it for me.

GregX59 (Omaha, NE) Posted: Feb 28, 2006 - 10:21  From Koko (Taylor) to Iko Iko. Pretty cool.
Who wrote it? I'm only familiar with Dr John's version.
Edited: 
Searched this up:
This song was written and recorded back in the early 1950's by a New Orleans singer named James Crawford who worked under the name of Sugar Boy & The Cane Cutters. In the original group were Professor Longhair on piano, Jake Myles, Big Boy Myles, Irv Bannister on guitar, and Eugene 'Bones' Jones on drums. This group was also known as the Cipaka Shaweez. The song was originally called 'Jockomo' and it has a lot of Creole patois in it. Jockomo means 'jester' in the old myth. It is Mardi Gras music, and the Shaweez was one of many Mardi Gras groups who dressed up in far out Indian costumes and came on as Indian tribes. The tribes used to hang out on Claiborne Avenue and used to get juiced up there getting ready to perform and 'second time' in their own special style during Mardi Gras. That's dead and gone now because there's a freeway where those grounds used to be. The tribes were like social clubs who lived all year for Mardi Gras. getting their costumes together. Many of them were musicians, gamblers, hustlers and pimps.

I think it was originally done in the early 60's by the Dixie Cups. In '82 it was released by the Belle Stars and charted in the UK, then in US in '89 as it was included on the 'Rain Man' soundtrack. If you want an offbeat version, it was recently remade by Oregon based Glass Candy.

ThePoose  Posted: Dec 15, 2005 - 06:38  And the late, great Harry Nillson did a rousing version!

It's that rolling beat. Very fun. The 80's version is my favorite (that I've heard so far... If I was in a band I'd love to cover this one!)
