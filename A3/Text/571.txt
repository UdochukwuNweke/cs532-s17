Recent News 
Myles Turner scored 17 points with nine rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block in 37 minutes against the Wizards on Thursday.  His first half puts him in the discussion for Most Improved Player, but Turner has seen a slight downward trend. He's seen his scoring, blocks and 3-point averages drop per game for each month from December to February. He's still held second-round value in standard leagues on the season and has exceeded every bit of hype. Feb 16 - 9:24 PM    Myles Turner was quiet vs. the Wizards on Friday, scoring 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting.  The Wizards are a top-10 team in terms of points allowed to opposing centers, so give Marcin Gortat credit for slowing Turner down. He logged 31 minutes and hit both of his free throws, adding seven rebounds, three assists and one block in 31 minutes. Expect him to bounce back in a much better matchup on Saturday vs. the Bucks. Feb 11 - 12:57 AM    Myles Turner (bronchitis) chipped in 16 points and seven rebounds vs. the Cavs on Wednesday, making 4-of-10 FGs and 8-of-8 FTs without any assists or defensive stats.  Cleveland gives up the sixth-fewest points to opposing centers, as well as the eighth-fewest blocks, so the matchup worked against Turner tonight. This was his highest-scoring game in February, so hopefully it will jump-start him offensively. He's in the mix for Most Improved Player honors and has been a steady second-round fantasy value all season. Feb 8 - 10:11 PM    Myles Turner (bronchitis) will be in the starting lineup for Wednesday's game against the Cavs.  Turner said he's feeling much better than he was on Monday, so perhaps he'll shoot at a higher clip tonight. Go ahead and get him active. Jeff Teague, C.J. Miles, Paul George and Lavoy Allen will join him in the starting five. Feb 8 - 6:15 PM  Source: Nate Taylor on Twitter         
Myles Turner finishes on a high note  Feb 16 - 9:24 PM Myles Turner struggles vs. Wizards  Feb 11 - 12:57 AM Myles Turner (bronchitis) posts 16 & 7 vs CLE  Feb 8 - 10:11 PM Confirmed: Myles Turner (illness) will start  Feb 8 - 6:15 PM

PF 1 Thaddeus Young  Sidelined Thaddeus Young (left wrist) will not play on Thursday vs. the Wizards. This is his seventh game in a row on the shelf, but it makes sense for the Pacers to hold him though the All-Star break. He now gets a full week of rest and will hopefully be ready on Feb. 24 against the Grizzlies. Lavoy Allen (knee) is questionable, so Kevin Seraphin could see 25+ minutes tonight. Feb 16 
2 Lavoy Allen  Sidelined Lavoy Allen (knee) will not play on Thursday night against the Wizards. That means Kevin Seraphin gets another start and a revenge game vs. his old team. Allen was a game-time call, so he should be ready after the break. Although, Thaddeus Young (wrist) should also be back, which would take away most of Allen's minutes. If you want to stream someone, give Seraphin, C.J. Miles or Glenn Robinson III a look.  RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Allen ruled out, Kevin Seraphin now becomes one of the more intriguing punt plays of the night, although that's not saying much given the two-game slate. We can likely pencil him in for around 25 minutes of court time, and given how thin PF is - Markieff Morris is the only &quot;strong&quot; option - Seraphin is viable in any format. His floor remains extremely low and Taj Gibson is the preferred cash game target, but Seraphin remains one of the few viable targets at the position. Feb 16
