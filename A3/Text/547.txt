Paul Carbuncle Nottingham &amp; Derby Roots Radio 
  Paul Carbuncle 
&#8220;Excellent!&#8221;, &#8220;Immaculate!&#8221;, &#8220;Wonderful views!&#8221;, &#8220;We had to ask for more towels!&#8221;. These are just some of the comments made by lovers of folk music who have stayed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in Paul Carbuncle&#8217;s home county of Kent. Now living in #Nottingham, Paul has been playing an interminable succession of gigs to sometimes sympathetic crowds all over the shop for the last few years, on evenings which have been described as both &#8220;Saturday&#8221; and &#8220;Wednesday&#8221;. The Midlands magazine &#8220;Folk Monthly&#8221; labelled him &#8220;bourgeoning&#8221;, back in the days before spell-check (2015). In a recent interview with a lady who said she was from off of the telly, Paul deftly cleared up once and for all any mystery surrounding his chosen musical genre. &#8220;Some call it folk-punk,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;while others call it punk-folk. Either is acceptable. But over-blend it and you’ll end up with funk or polk, and I’m sure none of us wants that. It’s rather like mixing the grape and the grain&#8230; you’ve got to be careful not to end up with muesli.&#8221; Paul Carbuncle uses Jim Dunlop 1mm plectrums.
