WEEI &raquo; Green Street  &raquo; It looks like Celtics might be eyeing Magic big man Nikola Vucevic 
It looks like Celtics might be eyeing Magic big man Nikola Vucevic 
01.29.17 at 7:44 pm ET 
By Rob Bradford 
Nikola Vucevic It&#8217;s not complicated: The Celtics need scoring and rebounding, and Nikola Vucevic can do both. 
So hearing CSNNE.com reporting the Celts have expressed interest in acquiring Vucevic should make all the sense in the world. 
The report states the Celtics and Magic have talked about a deal involving the 26-year-old center, who has just two fewer double-doubles (19) as the entire C&#8217;s team. The 7-foot Vucevic is currently averaging 13.8 points and 9.8 rebounds a game for lowly Orlando. 
Vucevic&#8217;s appeal also extends to the team-friendly four-year, $53 million rookie contract extension he inked. The deal pays him $11.75 million this season, $12.25 million next season and $12.75 in 2018-19. 
Two seasons ago, he averaged 19.3 points and 10.9 rebounds per contest, while totaling 18.2 points and 8.9 boards a game in 2015-16. Vucevic was taken 16th overall in the 2011 NBA draft out the University of Southern California. After his rookie season, he was dealt to the Magic in a four-team trade involving Dwight Howard.
