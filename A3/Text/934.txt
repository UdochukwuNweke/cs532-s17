Paul Millsap scored eight points with two rebounds, one assist, two steals and one 3-pointer during an ugly 99-84 loss to the Clippers on Wednesday.  After a big-time game in Portland on Monday, Millsap was on the other end of the spectrum. The Hawks are saying they will not be trading Millsap this month and now the Atlanta Journal-Constitution is reporting the Hawks are expected to be buyers as one of the most active teams at the deadline. Millsap has been a little disappointing, but he should still be an early-round guy going forward. Feb 16 - 1:17 AM  Source: Chris Vivlamore on Twitter         Coach Mike Budenholzer declared publicly on Monday that the Hawks will not trade Paul Millsap.  &quot;He’s not going anywhere,&quot; said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer, who also serves as president of basketball operations. &quot;You can write that.&quot; Can't ask for a better source, so we'll take this as final confirmation that Millsap will spend the rest of this season in the ATL. It's a risky move by Atlanta, as Millsap can become an unrestricted free agent in July and there's a chance they lose him for nothing if he walks. However, the Hawks can offer more money and more years than any other team and must feel confident they will re-sign him. Feb 14 - 10:20 AM  Source: Atlanta Journal-Constitution        Paul Millsap hit just 4-of-12 shots but also hit a 3-pointer and 12-of-12 free throws for 21 points, nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and four blocks in Monday's tough 109-104 overtime win over the Blazers.  Millsap hit an incredible shot to send the game to overtime and then hit some free throws to help the Hawks win the game. Portland scored the first seven points of overtime, but the Hawks responded with 12 unanswered points to get the tough road win. Millsap didn't have it tonight, yet still came through with a huge fantasy line, which puts him in elite company. Feb 14 - 2:17 AM    According to Marc Stein of ESPN, the Hawks are &quot;adamant&quot; that Paul Millsap will remain in Atlanta past the deadline.  Stein adds that skepticism about the Hawks' position has been &quot;fairly rampant,&quot; but for now it sounds like the Hawks could stand pat at the deadline. Millsap has a player option for the 2017-18 season that he's fully expected to decline, so the Hawks could end up losing him for nothing this summer unless they convince him to sign another lucrative long-term deal with the franchise. Feb 13 - 9:36 AM  Source: ESPN

SF 1 Thabo Sefolosha  Sidelined The Hawks have had discussions with other teams about Thabo Sefolosha with the deadline looming. Sefolosha is on a bargain of a contract at just under $3.9 million, but he will hit free agency this summer. The Hawks are looking to be buyers at the deadline, so Sefolosha and Tiago Splitter are the two most likely pieces to be moved to make a deal work. The Hawks are loaded with depth at SF and they may want to clear up more minutes for guys like Taurean Prince and DeAndre Bembry, but no deal is imminent at this time. He's not a great stash.

3 Tiago Splitter  Sidelined Tiago Splitter could be moved prior to the Feb. 23 deadline according to Hawks beat writer Chris Vivlamore. Splitter has yet to play this season due to injuries, but his expiring contract could be attractive to other teams. The Hawks are expected to be buyers at the deadline and Splitter might be the most likely to be traded in addition to Thabo Sefolosha. It's still unclear when Splitter will be cleared to play and there's no reason to stash him in almost any format. Feb 16
