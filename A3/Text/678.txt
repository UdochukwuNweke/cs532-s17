COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  EAST LANSING — They were relieved when it was over, because they knew what had been at stake. Oh, the Michigan State Spartans didn’t want to publicly pin its postseason hopes on beating rival Michigan this afternoon at the Breslin Center. But they understood what a loss to the Wolverines would’ve meant. And so it was when freshman star Miles Bridges swiped a pass, barreled downcourt and spotted Matt McQuaid waiting in the corner. A week ago he might have kept barreling, right into the lane and into the teeth of Michigan’s defense, and drawn a charge. But Bridges remains on a fast-track, and knew the bigger payoff was setting up a teammate that had been struggling. McQuaid took a perfect pass from Bridges and buried a roof-busting three, then bounded back down the court with his teammates. It wasn’t quite an exorcism for the freshman phenom, who can stumble over his own, immense talent. Nor was it a reboot for McQuaid, whose internal battle with himself leaves him pump-faking and playing hot potato with the basketball when he should be letting it fly.

Still, it was a moment, of both possibility and symbolism, of what this team still can be. That three came in the middle of a 21-7 Spartans run that flipped the game. And may have flipped the season. At the very least, the 70-62 win over U-M gave MSU a more plausible path to the postseason. It also stopped a three-game losing streak. “It’s an important game,” said Coach Tom Izzo. For what it stopped and, he hopes, for what it started. “I think we’re looking at this as getting a chance to do the things we still think we can accomplish,” he said. Making noise in the Big Ten tournament. Making the NCAA tournament. Having more than a cup of coffee once they get there. Izzo has rolled out teams in the past that were easy to dismiss mid-season. Teams that stagnated on offense or threw the ball away too often or played without sustained purpose and focus.

When injuries began to mount, it can makes things look even worse. Bridges’ ankle injury slowed this team’s development, and slowed his own, too. The uncertainty between him and his teammates played itself out in wobbly losses the last two weeks. From one game to the next they’ve revealed their lack of experience and togetherness, whether playing without smarts against Ohio State or without defensive toughness against Indiana. Last week, when big, beefy Purdue came to town, the Spartans played well for about a half. Which, as you may recall, wasn’t nearly enough. The challenge to shake off the uneven performances and find the grit to knock off surging U-M was MSU’s stiffest test of the season. So far. “It was thick in the air,” Izzo said of the tension leading up to the game. “There is definitely pressure on these kids. … When you lose three in a row, people aren’t happy with you.”    Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Michigan State 70, Michigan 62  Fullscreen    Post to Facebook  Posted!

Some years, the way to winning basketball shows itself more easily. Some years, though, the coach and players have to keep tinkering. Izzo used 11 players again today, as he has so often done this season. That’s two more than most coaches like to rotate into a tight game against a rival. Izzo, though, is searching for combinations and that will provide the best balance of scoring punch and defensive tenacity. That can mean swapping Winston for Tum Tum Nairn and Ward for Kenny Goins and Eron Harris for Alvin Ellis. All in an effort to find easier buckets on one end and plug up the basket on the other. For a stretch against the Wolverines, during that dominant run, Izzo found balance with Bridges, Winston, Ward, Ellis and McQuaid. And while the freshmen led that charge and Ellis helped shut down Zak Irvin, it was McQuaid who played like the revelation. Or at least like he used to play last year. The sophomore’s confidence battle is another reason these Spartans aren’t near their ceiling. Even today, Izzo had to berate McQuaid in the huddle for passing up too many shots. When he’s rolling, however, and hitting shots, and playing sneaky – and sticky – defense, MSU gets a dynamic, all-court presence. There’s a reason, said Winston, the team calls McQuaid “big-shot Quaid-O.” There’s a reason, too, that the team bombarded McQuaid in the locker room after his nine-point performance. Part of it is the team’s off-court chemistry, and part of it is that the group understands its parts still are greater than the whole. Today, the team took a step toward reversing that. Took a step toward keeping its postseason goals alive, too. Contact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @shawnwindsor . High five for MSU Sunday was the fifth straight victory for the Spartans over the Wolverines. It’s the longest winning streak for MSU in the series since Tom Izzo’s squad won eight straight from 1998-2002.
