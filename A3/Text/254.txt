Jane Fonda and Miley Cyrus attend the Women&#39;s March on Jan. 21, 2017 in Los Angeles. 
Miley Cyrus has her sights set on seeing Malia Obama back in the White House someday -- but this time, as president. "I HOPE this little baby runs for Prez! #MaliaForPresident You&#39;ve got my Vote!!!!!" she wrote on Instagram Sunday afternoon (Jan. 29), alongside a headline about the former president&#39;s daughter. The singer&#39;s comments come after Malia was reportedly seen at a Sundance Film Festival event in support of Standing Rock against the Dakota Access pipeline on Friday (Jan. 27). Actress Shailene Woodley, who was in attendance, spoke to Democracy Now , about it: "It was amazing to see Malia," she said in an interview. "To witness a human being and a woman coming into her own outside of her family and outside of the attachments that this country has on her, but someone who’s willing to participate in democracy because she chooses to, because she recognizes, regardless of her last name, that if she doesn’t participate in democracy, there will be no world for her future children." 
Malia, born in 1998, is only 18 years old right now -- so she&#39;s got a while to consider Miley&#39;s idea. (The United States Constitution states one needs to be at least 35 years old to be eligible to run for president.) For now, she&#39;s set to start an internship with producer Harvey Weinstein .    I HOPE this little baby runs for Prez! #MaliaForPresident You&#39;ve got my Vote!!!!! @happyhippiefdn s Malia Obama!
