NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Hundreds of people have gathered in Nashville to protest President Donald Trump&#8217;s travel ban. Local media reports the crowd made its way Sunday to the office of Republican U.S. Sen. Bob Corker. Without criticizing Trump, Corker said in a statement Sunday evening, &#8220;We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.&#8221; He added that the administration should &#8220;immediately make appropriate revisions&#8221; to the ban. Among the speakers was Nashville Mayor Megan Barry, who said &#8220;America is stronger and better when we have each other&#8217;s back.&#8221; Some of the signs carried by demonstrators read &#8220;We will love and protect each other&#8221; and &#8220;Ya&#8217;ll are welcome.&#8221; Trump&#8217;s order temporarily suspended immigration from seven majority Muslim countries. It also has halted a Syrian refugee program. ___ Information from: WKRN-TV, http://www.wkrn.com/    Copyright &copy; 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.
