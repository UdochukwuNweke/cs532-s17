Tom Brady would have no problem taking Vince Lombardi Trophy from Roger Goodell

Tom Brady and Roger Goodell. (John Camporeale/USA Today Sports) 
HOUSTON — In a Sunday interview with ESPN, Tom Brady said he would welcome the opportunity to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy from commissioner Roger Goodell, saying it would mean “we won the game.” 
Talking with Chris Berman, Brady touched on a few different aspects in advance of the Patriots’ trip to Houston, including the potential for an awkward podium situation with the commissioner. Brady said that wouldn’t be an issue. 
“Hopefully we’re in that position,” said Brady while praising the Falcons. “It’s going to take a big effort. 
“Their defense is fast and aggressive, everything that coach [Dan] Quinn preaches,” he added. “It’s important for us to not give them any extra possessions.” 
As he has done on a handful of occasions over the course of the 2016 season, Brady also commented on playing so late into his thirties, and the chance to get back to the Super Bowl at such an age. 
“You only get these opportunities so often,” he said.
