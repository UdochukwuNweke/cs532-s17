Donald Trump , the beleaguered neo-fascist referred to by some as &#8220;President of the United States,&#8221; has spent the last several days coming to terms with the fact that he&#8217;s not very well-liked by the American public. But highly visible protests like the  Women&#8217;s March on Washington aren&#8217;t the only way citizens are registering their dissent. Some are even taking to the airwaves: As Seattle&#8217;s Q13 News notes, a pirate station on the local FM dial has been airing a loop of YG and Nipsey Hussle &#8216;s “F*** Donald Trump“ for several days now. 
RadioInsight.com confirms that the call dial 101.9 in Seattle isn&#8217;t the only station playing the protest anthem on repeat. A separate, unrelated radio hack has also caused stations based in Kentucky and Indiana to play the song, which surprisingly doesn&#8217;t get old no matter how many times you hear it. 
Show your solidarity with the radio pirates and listen to &#8220;Fuck Donald Trump&#8221; below, via WorldStarHipHop.
