Archbishop Carroll improves to 19-2 with win over Hallandale in tournament
BY FABIAN LYON Special to the Miami Herald 
Archbishop Carroll took Hallandale&#x2019;s best shot and then delivered the one that extended its dream season to 19-2 at the Respect Series 3 Tournament presented by RMF Magazine and FloridaProspects.com After watching resurgent Hallandale hang around in the first half and cut the lead to 41-34 with 2:50 in the third quarter, Gus Derbeaux&#x2019;s three-pointer off a kickout pass from Christian Silva ignited the decisive run in a 63-48 victory at Chaminade on Saturday. Bulldogs coach Juan Hernandez, who has thrust himself into the Class 4A Coach of the Year conversation, said his team&#x2019;s unsung defense has been overshadowed by its signature drive-and-kick three-point shooters. &#x201C;Defense is something that doesn&#x2019;t get talked about enough,&#x201D; Hernandez said. &#x201C;Everybody looks at us like a bunch of three-pointer shooters, but we hang our hat on defense.  &#x201C;We felt in the third quarter there if we could get three consecutive stops it would be the difference in the game.&#x201D; Silva finished with a game-high 16 points for the Bulldogs, keyed by back-to-back three-pointers to close the second quarter and a steal and layup with a minute left to salt the game away.  
The RMF Magazine No. 11 Bulldogs broke the game open with a three-pointer from Gabriel Russo to open the fourth quarter, a three-point play from Joseph Gomez (13 points) and John Aarestrup&#x2019;s three-pointer of a pass from Gomez to push the lead to 57-42 with 4:30 left. &#x201C;In the second quarter they came back on us,&#x201D; Silva said. &#x201C;We stayed disciplined, and we stayed tough and got the lead back to double digits. &#x201C;I knew we had a special team here. We all work hard here. We are family. It&#x2019;s no surprise to be 19-2. The game was tough. Hallandale attacks the rim well, but we stuck to our defensive plan. We stayed in front of the ball and didn&#x2019;t allow them to shoot it.&#x201D; Devaris Parker, Jimmy Sylvain and Ashley Paul tied for a team-high nine points for the Chargers.  &#x25AA;&#xA0; Archbishop Carroll 63, Hallandale 48: AC (19-2): Aarestrup 12, Russo 3, Gomez 13, Derbeaux 9, Silva 16, Villamil 5, Barbic 4, Cordero 1.
