Union County wide receiver Shi Smith liked what he saw from Jake Bentley, Deebo Samuel, Bryan Edwards and the rest of South Carolina’s offense during the second half of the 2016 season. The speedster believes last year’s group of receivers, along with the addition of the 2017 signing class, will make it tough on opposing defenses next year. “With me, Deebo, OrTre (Smith) and Bryan coming in, there should be nobody that can stop us,” Smith told The State. Smith feels he’s a similar player to Samuel, who led the Gamecocks with 59 catches for 783 yards and eight total touchdowns last season. And OrTre Smith, a freshman who has already enrolled at USC, is similar to Edwards, who had 44 catches for 590 yards and four touchdowns as a true freshman. “I’ve watched film on OrTre and I’ve seen Bryan and Deebo play. Me and Deebo can probably play the same role, and OrTre and Bryan can probably play the same role,” Smith said. “Going up and getting the ball, that’s OrTre and Bryan. Me and Deebo, jet sweeps and getting in the slot and getting a matchup on a linebacker and go to work.” Smith, a four-star receiver who had offers from Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and others, committed to the Gamecocks in the summer. He said getting the opportunity to help build a program was enticing to him. “Everybody from my hometown asks me, ‘Why didn’t you go to Clemson? Why didn’t you go to Clemson?’ They’re full of good players,” Smith said. “I want to go somewhere where I can turn the program around and showcase my talent.” Smith, who made the Shrine Bowl, had 47 catches for 609 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior. He was also named the 4A Upper State Back of the Year. In the Shrine Bowl, featuring the top players from North and South Carolina, Smith had 96 receiving yards and scored the only touchdown for South Carolina on a 43-yard reception. Smith had 54 catches for 1,337 yards and 12 touchdowns as a junior before getting a new coach and playing in a less pass-happy offense in 2016. Despite his stats not being as strong, Smith said he was a better player this past season. “I think I’ve gotten better at catching the ball, keeping my eyes on the ball. And I’m a better route runner, setting the defender up to where he’ll go one way and I’ll go the other way,” he said. “I feel like I can contribute at receiver and at punt returner (at USC).”
