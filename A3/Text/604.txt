Plateau Sigma is a musical project born in the &#39;autumn of 2010, driven by one simple ambition: to unite the verb of primordial death and doom metal to the rarefied and sensual atmospheres of new wave of dark rock.

Track Name: Palladion 
(An Affront to Minerva) 
Only silence, shadows adorn us, feel our heart beating, sneaking in the dark. 
Then entering slowly through the gates of the temple, we could hear our heavy breath bouncing at distance between these walls.  
Thieves we are, and maybe as such we’ ll die, and she appears before us, tremendous, beautiful divine.  
Divine eyes. 
Seeing Minerva’s eyes. 
Decree has done, I heard her voice, she has spoken. Elysian fields, where all my troubles, are over.  
Elysian fields, where all my songs are over, and there is no field, no light, just Shadows. Averno… 
Track Name: The Bridge And The Abyss 
(An Ode to Mars) 
We follow the arcane paths, we stand at coortem,  
may fiery Mars throw his seed, may the gods protect us. 
On that bridge we did our doom, our soul at last relieved,  
our screams unleashed with lechery, symbolic rituals of spears.  
Searching for the glory of the past, the glory of a new roman sun!  
The bridge above the abyss 
The thin line over the vacuous darkness 
Gloriam sanguinis dei! 
In the void beneath our bridge, we did our doom. 
Track Name: Cvltrvm 
(A Prayer to Jupiter) 
Ritualia cum sanguine, 
Sanguine nectens spiritus, 
Substantia divina inebriat, 
Aut victoria, aut mortem. 
Father Jupiter, king of the Gods. My heart set free, to take life and give death. 
Oh, father of mine, protector of men, in you I commit my soul, I put this knife into flesh. 
Rituals in blood and flesh, it feeds our spirits. 
Divine essence is wine, to be drunk forever. 
Vinum et sanguis, 
Gloriam Iovis. 
Father of men, I pour my soul into you, with shivering prayers, I propitiate you. 
I’m the sorcerer, your word made flesh, mine is the power, to glorify your name. 
Track Name: Rituals pt.I 
(An Elegy to Venus) 
Goddess of desire, a ritual has begun, a throne is ready, to make you sit upon.  
Jupiter, his grace will send, and your light will never see the end.  
And finally you’ll be touched by the grace of Jupiter’s hand, and still, your light,  
will never see the end. 
Will never see….. 
Goddess of desire, a ritual of blood has begun. 
Obscure will be the sun, the glory of the Gods, 
the empire, the western sun, new emperor has come. 
Arcane spirits, the flesh now calls. 
Last moon in cancer and you went away, a reincarnated Venus, but you went away, 
lamps from the sky, ground for a thalamus, somewhere, on the mediterranean. 
And the moon that decreed you’re the queen, and the sky, it talks you’re the one, 
if you look to that sky you will see, the caress from the Gods on your skin.
