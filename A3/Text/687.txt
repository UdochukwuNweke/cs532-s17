VENTURA &gt;&gt; Not again. That uneasy feeling returned to the Sierra Canyon girls basketball team, that dread-inducing deja vu forming deep in their stomachs and creeping into the back of their minds. Ventura came charging back in the fourth quarter, much like South Salem (Oregon), Windward and Mission Hills did earlier this season to hand Sierra Canyon three crushing losses &#x2014; all by two points or less. This time Sierra Canyon closed it out. Sierra Canyon held off Ventura 52-46 on Saturday at the Ventura Showcase in a battle between possible CIF Southern Section Open Division teams. 
PHOTO GALLERY: Images of Sierra Canyon-Ventura girls basketball showdown &#x201c;Today we did not give up. We did not let up,&#x201d; Sierra Canyon guard Ryann Payne said. &#x201c;It was down to four points. Yeah, they&#x2019;re close, but we were going to keep going. That was our mentality. We were not going to lose this game. Not today.&#x201d; Sierra Canyon (18-3) led 39-24 after three quarters, but sure enough, Ventura (17-5) clawed back within striking distance. Jazmin Carrasco&#x2019;s 3-pointer with 2:48 left brought Ventura within 45-41, but Sierra Canyon made sure it stopped there. 
Alexis Griggsby hit a big basket with 1:45 left, and Amanda Olinger scored on a putback to help Sierra Canyon restore order. Griggsby and Savannah Lewis combined to hit 3 of 4 free throws in the final minute to help ensure the victory. &#x201c;We can finally say we did what we were supposed to do at the end of a game,&#x201d; Sierra Canyon coach Alicia Komaki said. Griggsby was a sight for sore eyes, returning to the court for the first time since fracturing her nose Jan. 17 against Windward, a three-game absence. 
And Griggsby was equipped with a bulky face mask to protect her recovering nose. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Rip mask,&#x201d; Griggsby said, comparing her mask to the one Richard Hamilton of the Pistons wore when he broke his nose. Griggsby managed eight points. And while Sierra Canyon was ragged at times offensively, the fact it had its Long Beach State recruit back on the floor and it showed an ability to close out games were certainly positives. Even if the Rip mask was a bit restrictive for her. &#x201c;It was a little blurry and hard to see,&#x201d; Griggsby said. &#x201c;Playing in it was hard. Getting hit in the cheekbone, it hurt. But I just had to go through it.&#x201d;

Payne led Sierra Canyon with 14 points. Sophia Jacobsson totaled 11 points for Sierra Canyon, including a trio of 3-pointers. Amanda Olinger had eight points, connecting on a pair of key second-half 3-pointers. &#x201c;I was really struggling in the first half, and I had to make sure I was getting rebounds and I was doing my job,&#x201d; Olinger said. Aubrey Knight led Ventura with 15 points. Carrasco, Savannah Page and Emily Herring each added eight points with Carrasco scoring all of her points in the fourth quarter. 
But Sierra Canyon showed it is continuing in its progression as one of the state&#x2019;s top power brokers this season as it develops its finishing touch. &#x201c;In our past games, we have been really close but have not been able to close out,&#x201d; Griggsby said. &#x201c;It feels good that when they started getting close, we finally pushed out and got a win.&#x201d;
