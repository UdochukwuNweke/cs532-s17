CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  LOS ANGELES — Breaking down Sunday’s NHL All-Star Game at Staples Center. THE BIG PICTURE:  Led by fill-in coach Wayne Gretzky, the Metropolitan Division beat the Atlantic Division 10-6 and then the Pacific Division 4-3 to win the All-Star tournament. Philadelphia Flyers winger Wayne Simmonds scored three goals and was named the MVP. The Pacific team advanced to the final after beating the Central Division 10-3. WHAT WE’LL BE TALKING ABOUT: This was the second year for the four-team, three-on-three format, and while it can be a hoot to see the world’s best players turn on the skill, the first two games lacked edge. Or as St. Louis Blues winger Vladimir Tarasenko said when asked about the Central's loss, “I really can’t talk about this game seriously.” Tarasenko wasn't around for the final, which was far more competitive on the scoreboard and more intense on the ice. Funny how a $1 million prize to the winning team can help. MORE:  NHL Skills Competition delivers something for everyone    NHL All-Stars weigh in on keys to three-on-three    Notable players missing from NHL&#39;s Top 100 of all time   'OTHER' MVP:  Goalies are typically the subjects of abuse in the All-Star Game, but Braden Holtby of Washington Capitals was the best player on the ice for the Metropolitan Division. The last goalie to be named MVP of the All-Star Game was Mike Richter in 1994, and it should have been Holtby on Sunday. He stopped 17 of 20 shots on the day, including all five in the final. REALITY CHECK: All-Star Games are famously light on the physical play, but Washington Capitals winger Alex Ovechkin did lay a check on Boston Bruins winger Brad Marchand. Twice. KEY STAT: The Chicago Blackhawks trio of Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews and Duncan Keith combined for a plus-minus rating of minus-9 while playing for the Central Division. Each player was named to NHL’s list of top 100 players on Friday.    Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn NHL 2017 All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles  Fullscreen    Post to Facebook  Posted!
