Jan 30, 2017  Share Tweet    Image via Getty/Erika Goldring  In the wake of Donald Trump &#x2019;s travel ban on certain Muslim-majority nations , a slew of celebrities have come forth to not only condemn the order, but to also provide a few words of hope and encouragement. On Saturday night, gospel singer Kirk Franklin joined the conversation with tweet that promoted unity and acceptance. This, of course, upset a few people; however, there was one particular troll who wasn&#x2019;t ready for Franklin&#x2019;s clap back.

Franklin response? Well, let&apos;s just say he isn&apos;t about to turn the other cheek.&#xA0; 
@HistoryCarper yes I have a daughter and the ability to protect her. Please come so I can have a reason to introduce you to it in Jesus name
