Reject Trump's Muslim Ban 
Petition by 
Linda Sarsour 
To be delivered to 
The United States House of Representatives and The United States Senate 
Petition Statement 
Targeting people based on their religion is wrong and unconstitutional. Shutting the doors on some of the most vulnerable people in the world—refugees seeking safety—shows a moral bankruptcy that is shocking even for Donald Trump. We demand that you go on record and resoundingly reject Trump's Muslim ban. 
There are currently 378,490 signatures.
NEW goal - 
We need 400,000 signatures!
Petition Background 
Donald Trump has signed an executive order blocking refugees from seeking safety and restricting immigration from Muslim countries—a Muslim ban in everything but name.  While the Trump administration has backpedaled on his call for &quot;a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States&quot;—realizing the weakness of his mandate and the unpopularity of his policies—it's clear that these orders are driven by a deep-seated, almost maniacal anti-Muslim hate that has captured Trump and his cabinet.  And his call to block Syrian refugees—some of the most vulnerable people in the world—is shockingly morally bankrupt, even for someone like Trump.  We reject targeting of anyone based on their religion or where they come from, and call on members of Congress to go on the record and vocally reject Trump's Muslim ban.
