BEHIND THE GROOVES: a music blog by Jeff Harris
On this day in music history: January 29, 1985 - &ldquo;Stella&rdquo;, the fourth album by Yello is released. Produced by Boris Blank and Yello, it is recorded at Yello Studio in Zurich, Switzerland from Mid - Late 1984. Known for their pioneering use of sampling in their work, anchored by the unique and distinctive baritone voice of vocalist Dieter Meier, it is the most successful album for the Swiss electronic music duo. The single &ldquo;Oh Yeah&rdquo; (#51 US Pop) goes on to become their best known song, being featured in numerous films and television shows including &ldquo;Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Secret Of My Succe$s&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;. The album is remastered and reissued in Europe in November of 2005, with four additional bonus tracks added, including the 12" mixes of &ldquo;Oh Yeah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Desire&rdquo;. &ldquo;Stella&rdquo; hits number one on the Swiss Pop album chart, and number ninety two on the UK album chart.
