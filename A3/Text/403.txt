LeBron James and Kyrie Irving towed the Cleveland Cavaliers past the Oklahoma City Thunder, 107-91, as the defending NBA champions look to get back on track after a turbulent week. 
Oklahoma City&#39;s All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook registered his 24th triple-double of the season with 20 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, but he made only seven of 26 attempts.

James had 25 points, 14 boards, and eight assists, while Irving tallied 29 points and 10 assists as the Cavaliers improved to 31-14 in the season. The Thunder dropped to 28-19. 
The Cavaliers have now won back-to-back games since a difficult stretch that saw them lose 6 of 8 games and had James openly questioning the roster moves that their front office made. 
Cleveland pulled away in the second quarter, as they outscored the Thunder, 37-21, to turn a slim 21-24 deficit into a 58-45 halftime advantage. The defending champions never looked back from that point, eventually leading by as much as 20 points in the final frame. 
Victor Oladipo had 17 points for the Thunder, who were held to only 37% shooting from the field including only 23.1% from beyond the arc. 
Cleveland, meanwhile, made 44.6% of their shots. 
The Cavaliers played the second half without Kevin Love, who is still dealing with back spasms.
