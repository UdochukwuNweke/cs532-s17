Wichita State Holds Off Pacific, 4-3 
Jan 29, 2017 
FORT WORTH, Texas - No. 3-seed Wichita State defeated four-seed Pacific on Sunday in the consolation match of the TCU Regional held at the Bayard H. Friedman Tennis Center. The TCU Regional is one of 15 sites in the 2017 ITA Kick-Off Weekend. 
"Heartbreaker today, classic college match," Pacific coach Ryan Redondo said. "(There were) great comebacks and some losses that will keep you up at night. Wichita State pulled it out and took it from us. We had our chances but didn't close them out." 
In doubles action, on court one, the duo of Alex Giannini and Tadiwa Chinamo for Pacific (2-2) defeated Jan Poboril and Miroslav Herzan 6-1. Wichita State (1-3) won on court three when Jocelyn Devilliers and Connor Devlin downed Miguel Diaz and Lance Ngo 6-3. The Tigers took a 1-0 edge heading into singles play when Ross Watson and Akram El Sallaly defeated Eddie Stoica and Haru Inoue 6-4 on court two. 
In singles play, the Shockers tied the match at one when Murkel Dellien defeated Watson 6-2, 6-1 on court five. Diaz regained the upper hand for his team, 2-1, after dispatching Herzan in straight sets 6-4, 6-1 on court two. Marius Frosa defeated Giannini 6-2, 6-4 on court four to knot the match at two. Stoica gave his team a 3-2 edge on court six after holding off Kumara Pardha Adavelly 7-6 (7-1), 6-2. In No. 3 singles, El Sallaly took care of Devilliers 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2 to force a winner-take-all situation on court one between Inoue and Chinamo. 
Chinamo took the first game 6-4, but Inoue came back to win games two and three 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, respectively. 
"I am encouraged and loved the fight that I saw and can't wait to get back on the courts and compete again," Redondo commented. "(It was) just a great dog fight to learn from in January." 
The Tigers hosts Hawai'i (10 a.m. PT) and Portland State (2:30 p.m.) on Saturday, Feb. 4.
