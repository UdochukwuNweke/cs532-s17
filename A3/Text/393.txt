&laquo; Is it time to blow Pakistan off the map? And now, the latest from the United Nations Choir &raquo;    
Barack H. Obama, a real class act           
Or, a classic moron. So, what did &#8220;The One&#8221; do this time to cover himself with glory? It seems there was this photo opp at the recent gathering of world leaders from various nations at the OpenÂ Government Partnership event. Once again, President &#8220;Present&#8221; distinguished himself. 
So what did &#8220;His Oneness&#8221; do this time? One picture is worth a thousand words. 
Here we have Obama, once again embarrassing himself and the United States. What he has done is cover over the face of Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj who is the current President of Mongolia. 
Nice going Barry! 
Of course, there is a video of what actually happened. 
Thanks to Michael Deppisch who was lucky enough to be there with a camera. ðŸ˜‰ 
What an absolute disgrace to the planet.

That picture looks photoshopped.

surprisingly, it isn&#8217;t. It was originally posted MSNBC and somehow I doubt they would fake something like that.
