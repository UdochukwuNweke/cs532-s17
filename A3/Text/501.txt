India Knight, a columnist for The Sunday Times, tweeted &#8220;The assassination is taking such a long time.&#8221;            
The assassination is taking such a long time.            
&mdash; India Knight (@indiaknight) January 28, 2017     
Although she doesn&#8217;t mention a name, who else would she be referring to other than President Trump?            
Columnist for @thesundaytimes inciting murder against @POTUS ? ü§î https://t.co/pvGjtaizM9            
&mdash; Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 29, 2017         
If you take a look at the time she tweeted this, it was TWO DAYS ago! Yet her tweet still hasn&#8217;t been deleted as of Sunday, and the account isn&#8217;t suspended. Is Jack paying attention to this? Or is he just going to give another pass on this like he typically does?            
And has Secret Service even seen this? The question is if any action from them have been taken from this tweet.            
This is pathetic. Journalists calling for the assassination of Trump. And the scary fact is she isn&#8217;t the first one to do so.
