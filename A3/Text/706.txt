Gallup, which has measured job approval for presidents for decades, shows Trump's approval so far at 45%, with 48% disapproving. That's an average of several days' polling.   The daily trend lines are not kind to the new administration. As of Saturday, 51% of Americans disapproved of Trump's performance.   That's a record for the speed of getting to majority disapproval.   By comparison, President George W. Bush hit majority disapproval six months into his second term, in June 2005, and remained in negative territory for the rest of his tenure.   President Obama did not hit 51% disapproval until August of 2011, during the crisis over the federal debt ceiling that summer. His approval rebounded later that year, but he had a second period of majority disapproval during late 2013 and much of 2014. He ended his term with widespread approval and 37% of Americans disapproving.                  Latest updates                 Copyright      &copy; 2017, Los Angeles Times
