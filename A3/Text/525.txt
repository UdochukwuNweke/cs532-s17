Uploaded on Jan 19, 2008 This is Chicago with "Hard To Say I'm Sorry" from a Spanish TV show. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyrics (thanks to Supersweetguy): Hard To Say I'm Sorry (1982) "Everybody needs a little time away." I heard her say, "From each other." "Even lovers need a holiday. Far away, from each other" Hold me now It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just the part of me I can't let go (Ooo ooo) Couldn't stand to be kept away Just for the day From your body Wouldn't wanna be swept away Far away, from the one that I love Hold me now It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to know Hold me now I really want to tell you I'm sorry I could never let you go After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just the part of me I can't let go After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to You're gonna be the lucky one When we get there gonna jump in the air No one will see us 'cause there's nobody there After all, you know we really don't care Hold on, I'm gonna take you there
