Goal summarises the biggest transfer talk from the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, the Bundesliga and beyond 
MAN CITY EYE WORLD-RECORD ALLI BID 
Manchester City are ready to make a world-record bid for Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli, according to the Daily Express . 
The Spurs midfielder has starred since his move from MK Dons, and Pep Guardiola&#39;s side are now willing to make a bid that could top the &pound;89 million that Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba.
BARCA BAG MINA 
Barcelona have completed a deal that will see Palmeiras defender Yerry Mina move to Camp Nou in January 2018, according to Mundo Deportivo . 
The Colombia international has been a much sought-after talent, with Manchester City among those to express an interest in signing him, but his promising career is set to continue in La Liga. 
DIARRA SET FOR CHINA 
Former Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder Lassana Diarra is set to become the latest high-profile figure to head for China, according to La Provence . 
The France international has had his contract terminated by Marseille, freeing him to discuss a move to Asia. 
TERRY SNUBS MLS MOVE 
Chelsea captain John Terry has turned down lucrative offers from three Major League Soccer sides, according to the Daily Star . 
The former England international&#39;s current contract at Stamford Bridge will expire in the summer, and he has decided to see that deal out rather than link up with LA Galaxy, New York Red Bulls or Orlando City ahead of the 2017 MLS campaign. 
MAN CITY TRACKING LEMAR 
Manchester City are monitoring Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar, reports L&#39;Equipe . 
The 21-year-old is also said to be attracting interest from Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich after impressing in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. 
OTAMENDI TO REPLACE PEPE 
Real Madrid see Manchester City&#39;s Nicolas Otamendi as a potential replacement for Pepe, should the latter move to China, TyCSports says . 
The Argentine centre-back, 29, joined City from Valencia in August 2015 and has made 20 Premier League appearances this season. However, with rumours suggesting 33-year-old Pepe could be on his way to the Chinese Super League, the Champions League holders see Otamendi as a candidate for the centre of defence. 
CARRICK SET FOR TALKS 
Michael Carrick is set for talks with Manchester United over a new contract, the Daily Mail report. 
The midfielder reportedly could put pen to paper on a new one-year deal should discussions with the club&#39;s hierarchy go well in the coming weeks. 
ROSE REJECTED CSL 
Danny Rose turned down an approach from the Chinese Super League to remain loyal to Tottenham, according to The Sun . 
The full-back reportedly snubbed an offer which would have earned him &pound;14.5 million-a-year. 
COSTA AGREES CHELSEA DEAL 
Diego Costa has agreed a new five-year contract at Chelsea which will see him earn at least &pound;220,000 per week, according to The Sun . 
The striker has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge over the past 12 months, but the Blues have now moved to secure the Spain international&#39;s future with a huge offer. 
SPURS NOT GIVING UP ON ZAHA 
Tottenham are planning a summer bid for Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha after missing out in January, according to the Daily Express . 
Mauricio Pochettino is a major admirer of the former Manchester United wideman, and Spurs will make an offer at the end of the season whether Palace are relegated or not. 
BARCELONA LOOKING AT RIGHT-BACK 
Barcelona are interested in signing Las Palmas right-back Michel Macedo in the summer, according to reports from Marca. 
With Aleix Vidal suffering a long-term injury, Luis Enrique has turned his attention to Michel, who has made 19 La Liga starts this season, though Las Palmas chiefs insist they have no knowledge of the interest. 
EVERTON WANT SAGNA 
Everton have joined Premier League rivals West Ham in the race for Manchester City&#39;s Bacary Sagna, according to a report from 10 Sport . 
The Frenchman&#39;s deal at the Etihad expires at the end of the current campaign but will not be extended by Pep Guardiola, leaving the road open for both the Toffees and the Hammers to make a move ahead of a summer transfer. 
MOURINHO WANTS BELOTTI 
Manchester United have earmarked Torino&#39;s Andrea Belotti as a long-term option to lead their attack, Tuttomercatoweb reports. 
The Italian outlet claims the Red Devils have been sending scouts to keep tabs on the in-form 23-year-old striker, though no official contact has been made between the clubs. 
RASHFORD STALLING ON NEW DEAL 
Marcus Rashford is stalling on signing a new Manchester United contract due to a lack of first-team opportunities, according to The Times . 
The striker will consider his position with the Red Devils at the end of the season amid fears he may never get an extended run in the team under Jose Mourinho. 
TOTTENHAM TRACKING MARTIAL 
Tottenham are monitoring Anthony Martial&#39;s situation at Manchester United amid speculation he could be unsettled at Old Trafford, according to the Daily Mirror . 
Martial has returned to form in recent weeks but still has work to do to convince Jose Mourinho he is a long-term member of his starting XI. 
GUARDIOLA EYEING HERNANDEZ BROS 
Pep Guardiola wants to launch a &pound;40 million double move to sign Atletico Madrid brothers Lucas and Theo Hernandez, according to the Sun . 
Lucas, a centre-back, is impressing with Atleti this season while left-back Theo has risen to prominence on loan at Alaves, who have reached the Copa del Rey final. 
MAN UTD &amp; LIVERPOOL SCOUT MALCOM 
Liverpool and Manchester United sent scouts to watch Bordeaux winger Malcom in action against PSG on Friday, according to Girondinfos . 
The young Brazilian has been one of the revelations of the season in Ligue 1 this season and has attracted the interest of several top sides. 
SPURS JOIN ARSENAL IN MBAPPE RACE 
Tottenham have joined rivals Arsenal in the race for highly rated teenager Kylian Mbappe, according to the Daily Mirror . 
The 18-year-old striker has been drawing rave reviews at Monaco, and netted a hat-trick in his club&rsquo;s 5-0 win over Metz on Saturday. Mbappe, who has been compared to Thierry Henry, has a contract with Monaco until 2019. 
MAN UTD OFFER DE GEA BUMPER DEAL 
Manchester United are planning on offering David de Gea a massive new contract to keep him away from Real Madrid, according to the Daily Star . 
The Spanish giants are rumoured to be keen on bringing the goalkeeper to Madrid, and the Red Devils will bump his salary from &pound;200k-a-week to nearly &pound;300k-a-week in an effort to keep him at Old Trafford. 
MILAN TO MAKE &pound;45M ALEXIS BID 
AC Milan are plotting a &pound;45 million summer bid for Arsenal contract holdout Alexis Sanchez, according to the Daily Express . 
The Chilean&#39;s deal at the Emirates Stadium expires in 2018 and the Italians are willing to offer him &pound;250,000 a week, significantly more than what is currently on the table in north London.
