As seen on Justice With Judge Jeanine

// First 100 Days     // Donald Trump     // Illegal Immigration     // sanctuary cities   
In her opening statement on Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed critics of President Trump's hard-line stance on illegal immigration, including liberal mayors of sanctuary cities. 
"You can march and you can hate; you can shame and you can demonize, but... law and order is back in the West," Pirro said, referring to Trump's executive order withholding federal grant money to cities who will not enforce federal immigration law. 
Pirro said such mayors, like Ed Lee (D-San Francisco) and Bill de Blasio (D-New York), will only hurt their own residents when severe budget cuts must be made.

De Blasio said last week Trump's order "undermines public safety", and the city's comptroller Scott Stringer (D) said New York may lose as much as $7 billion because of it.

Citing her time as a district attorney and judge, Pirro dismissed some mayors' claims that illegal immigrants can greatly contribute to the community by identifying crimes without fear of apprehension. 
"It doesn't work," Pirro said, explaining that as district attorney she used a "U-Visa" to allow illegal immigrants to report crimes. 
She said that such an avenue makes a blanket "sanctuary city" policy unnecessary.
