Red-state Democrats must win over thousands of Trump voters to have any hope of being reelected in 2018. But they won’t be doing it by defending the president’s controversial executive order barring some immigrants and refugees from entering the country. 
Over the weekend, all but one of the most endangered Senate Democrats rebuked Donald Trump’s directive to stop admitting refugees from Syria, pause accepting refugees from other nations and restrict the travel of people from seven Muslim-majority countries to the United States. Story Continued Below 
Ten Democrats are up for reelection in Trump states, five of them from states he overwhelmingly won. But no senators from those deeply conservative states endorsing Trump's move, depriving the White House of a bipartisan stamp of approval. 
In fact, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a state that Trump carried by 19 percentage points, said that Trump’s actions make her “want to throw up.” 
Others said that Trump’s decision is counterproductive to national security. Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, a state that Trump won by nearly 20 points, said “we can make our country even safer and do so in a way that is consistent with our values. The executive order that was signed yesterday by President Trump is not one of those ways.” Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, where Trump also beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points, said Trump’s order is “having harmful consequences on children and braves allies who are helping us fight terrorism.”

And Sen. Heidi Heitkamp issued a detailed takedown of Trump's executive order, deeming it &quot;outrageous.&quot; Heitkamp had been in the mix to be Trump's agriculture secretary last year, and Trump won North Dakota by about 36 points. 
&quot;The ban hurts us in the war against ISIS. It isolates Muslims living in the U.S. who help root out potential terrorists. It hurts those from countries like Iraq and Syria who have served as translators, bodyguards, and informants,&quot; she said . &quot;It also confirms the lie terrorists tell their recruits: that America is waging a war on Islam. This is outrageous.&quot; 
Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a potential challenger to Heitkamp, said that &quot;what Donald Trump is doing is he’s pulling America’s head out of the sand.&quot; He went on to say that critics were comparing elderly ladies from Europe to &quot;young Muslim men from Syria,&quot; according to the Grand Forks Herald. 
Sen. Joe Manchin, whose home state of West Virginia Trump won by 42 points, had no immediate comment. Manchin was in the running to be his energy secretary and has been warmer to Trump than any other Senate Democrat. 
Democrats to rally against Trump ban at Supreme Court

Other Democrats from states that Trump carried more narrowly also came out against his directive. 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, which has a significant Muslim population, tweeted that Trump “hurts our families &amp; businesses and doesn't make us safer.&quot; Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who spent Saturday night with protesters at the Philadelphia airport, accused Trump of taking “politically motivated discriminatory actions.” Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida called Trump's policies &quot;hastily-issued&quot; and said it is &quot;not the answer&quot; for national security. Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Sherrod Brown of Ohio were also critical. 
Republicans up for reelection in competitive states weren't exactly rushing to Trump's defense, either. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called the order “unacceptable,&quot; and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said the order is &quot;overly broad and that he is &quot;deeply troubled by the appearance of a religious ban.&quot; 
A number of House Republicans representing swing districts also came out against Trump.
