Top Senate Democrat announces legislation to reverse Trump’s immigration executive order

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) announced on Twitter late Sunday that she is preparing to introduce two bills on Monday in response to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s recent executive order on immigration and refugees. 
In a series of three tweets, Feinstein said that Trump should not be able to &ldquo;unilaterally ban groups of immigrants,&rdquo; which is why she is preparing to introduce the legislation. 
Feinstein said the first bill would rescind Trump&rsquo;s executive order while the second would limit Trump&rsquo;s executive authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
(1/3) Congress must take swift action in response to President Trump&rsquo;s discriminatory order. I am drafting two bills to introduce tomorrow. 
&mdash; Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) January 29, 2017 
(2/3) The first bill immediately rescinds the order. The second limits executive authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
&mdash; Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) January 29, 2017 
(3/3) Under our bill, the president would not be able to unilaterally ban groups of immigrants. 
&mdash; Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) January 29, 2017 
Feinstein, who vice chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, wasn&rsquo;t the only Democratic senator to discuss introducing legislation next week opposing Trump&rsquo;s order. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed on Sunday that Democrats in the Senate would push legislation this week seeking to undo Trump&rsquo;s executive order. 
He said that such legislation could be successful if enough Republicans get on board. Some Republican senators have already openly opposed Trump&rsquo;s order, including: Iowa Sen. Ben Sasse, Arizona Sen. John McCain, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman. 
In addition to the legislation, House and Senate Democrats plan to hold a protest on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday. 
Trump&rsquo;s executive order, signed late Friday, temporarily halts the U.S. refugee resettlement program for 120 days until the Trump administration can create an effective vetting process. The order also bars people from seven Muslim-majority countries &mdash; Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Somalia &mdash; from entering the U.S. for the next 90 days.
