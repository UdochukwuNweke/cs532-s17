Published 6:17 p.m. CT Jan. 29, 2017 | Updated 6:47 p.m. CT Jan. 29, 2017      Basketball (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)    CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  Madison – The Wisconsin women’s basketball team bounced back in the third quarter, but Indiana used a fourth-quarter rally to beat the Badgers, 78-54, on Sunday in the Kohl Center. UW rallied from a 35-29 deficit at the half to tie the game five times in the third quarter and took the lead twice. “I think we battled for 29 minutes tonight. Indiana, they are an explosive team,” UW head coach Jonathan Tsipis said. “I thought with about a minute left (in the third quarter), we just made some key mistakes. We allowed the ball into the paint." The Badgers (5-16, 0-8 Big Ten) came out firing on all cylinders after the break. Senior Kendall Shaw got the ball rolling immediately, nailing a shot in the paint 10 seconds into the third quarter. And from that, a fire was ignited in the Badgers. However, Indiana found the spark it needed with a 5-0 run at the end of the third that carried the Hoosiers’ drive into a tumultuous fourth quarter. Indiana (15-6, 5-3) outscored UW, 21-3, in the final quarter with the Hoosiers going to the free-throw line 18 times.
