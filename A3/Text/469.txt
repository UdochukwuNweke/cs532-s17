After Fox News Sunday&#8217;s Chris Wallace grilled White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on chief strategist Steve Bannon&#8217;s condemnation of the media, asking her is she could see how offensive it was, the veteran pollster went on a rant about how media outlets need to start firing people who criticized President Donald Trump . 
&#8220;Who is cleaning house,&#8221; Conway asked. &#8220;Which one is going to be the first network to get rid of these people who said things that were just not true? Talk about fake news, talk about alternative facts.&#8221; 
After complaining about how her coining the term &#8220;alternative facts&#8221; was the only thing that attention from her Sunday show appearances last week, Conway once again called for networks to can pundits and commentators who have &#8220;talked smack&#8221; about Trump. 
Not one network person has been let go. Not one silly political analyst and pundit who talked smack all day long about Donald Trump has been let go. They’re on panels every Sunday, they are on cable news every day. Who is the first editorial writer, where is the first blogger that will be let go that embarrassed his or her outlets? We know all their names. 
Conway also told Wallace she was &#8220;too polite to call them out by name&#8221; but that they &#8220;know who they are.&#8221; 
It should be noted that earlier this morning, Trump took to Twitter to rail against the New York Times &#8212; a favorite target of his &#8212; and recommended someone buy the paper to either &#8220;run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!&#8221; 
Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!
