EL SEGUNDO &gt;&gt; Even with the time away from basketball, D&#x2019;Angelo Russell spent Sunday in his first practice in over a week showing his lack of limitations. Despite missing the past three games with a mild MCL sprain in his right knee and a strained right calf, the Lakers&#x2019; second-year point guard completed all of Sunday&#x2019;s practice without any restrictions. He reported that he felt &#x201c;good&#x201d; and did not feel any rustiness. Most of the shots during the end of the practice went into the basket. Even if the Lakers (16-34) technically have listed Russell as questionable for Tuesday&#x2019;s game against the Denver Nuggets (21-25) at Staples Center, both Russell and Lakers coach Luke Walton sounded optimistic he will play. 
That prompted Walton to offer a playful dig to Russell. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re moving so well I&#x2019;m surprised that you couldn&#x2019;t play 3-on-3 yesterday,&#x201d; Walton told Russell. The Lakers technically had the day off on Saturday, though plenty of players reported to the team&#x2019;s practice facility for informal work. Since Russell felt his knee hurt too much to play in 3-on-3 drills, he spent Saturday working out in the weight room and completing sprinting drills. Still, Russell does not expect to experience rustiness as he did when he had 13 games earlier this season because of a sore left knee. 
&#x201c;This one wasn&#x2019;t that serious,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;Last injury, I would say it was a little more serious. So I had to take a little more time off.&#x201d; During his time off, Russell watched some painful developments. Last week, the Lakers suffered their most lopsided loss in franchise history in a 49-point defeat to Dallas. While Lakers rookie Brandon Ingram posted six points on 2-of-12 shooting as a starting point guard last week in Dallas, he moved back to the second unit and went scoreless on a combined 0-of-11 clip in the past two games. In two starts in Portland and Utah, Lakers veteran guard Jose Calderon went scoreless and missed a combined six shots. 
Once Russell returns, can he match and elevate his season-long averages of 14.3 points on 39.6 percent shooting and 4.4 assists? &#x201c;We expect him to play. It&#x2019;s not like we don&#x2019;t think he can penetrate teams&#x2019; defenses or anything like that,&#x201d; Walton said. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s cleared to play, we expect what we&#x2019;d always expect out of him.&#x201d; That goes beyond producing. The Lakers have wanted Russell to fill the leadership vacuum that no one took ownership of during his absence. &#x201c;Like most young guys, it&#x2019;s great sometimes and not so great other times,&#x201d; Walton said of Russell&#x2019;s leadership. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy at this level.&#x201d;

Still, the Lakers have reported Russell showing relative improvement in that area. &#x201c;I try to lead by example more than just talk,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to talk and not produce. So I try to produce more and then let the talking feed off of that.&#x201d; Say you&#x2019;re sorry With the benefit of hindsight, Walton wished he changed his recent coaching approach with Lakers third-year forward Julius Randle a bit differently. &#x201c;I felt bad I got on him that bad in the film session,&#x201d; Walton said. Walton still plans to issue tough love to Randle. Nonetheless, the Lakers&#x2019; coach offered some contrition over his recent criticisms because he was unaware Randle had pneumonia. 
The Lakers have ruled Randle out for at least today when he will be reevaluated. That did not stop him from watching practice wearing a sweatshirt. Afterward, Randle remarked that he felt better. &#x201c;The training staff said he is not contagious,&#x201d; Walton said. &#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t touch him.&#x201d; Walton put Randle on the active roster during Thursday&#x2019;s loss to Utah, though he did not play for precautionary reasons. The Lakers listed Randle as questionable for Tuesday against Denver. Deng likely unaffected Lakers forward Luol Deng is not expected to be affected by President Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order that bans refugees from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to enter the United States. 
Deng has dual citizenship in his native South Sudan and in Great Britain, which granted his family political asylum. He also has a green card in the United States, where he has lived since age 14 when he attended Blair Academy in Blairstown, NJ. Deng&#x2019;s native South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.
