Ride Sharing Companies Get Caught Up In Donald Trump's Immigration Ban &#8212; Here Is Why TONS Of People Are Deleting Their Uber Accounts!

Look out, Uber and Lyft &#8212; your politics are coming front and center in light of Donald Trump 's immigration ban! 
Thousands of people across America are actively deleting their Uber accounts &#8212; and posting to social media about it &#8212; while picking up Lyft, instead, and it all has to do with that awful executive order the President signed on Friday night.

It all started at New York's JFK Airport over the weekend; cab companies &#8212; many of whom have drivers hailing from the seven countries specifically named in Trump's Muslim ban &#8212; walked out and refused to do passenger pickups, as you can see (below): 
NO PICKUPS @ JFK Airport 6 PM to 7 PM today. Drivers stand in solidarity with thousands protesting inhumane &#038; unconstitutional #MuslimBan .

Amazing!!! 
But Uber didn't stop &#8212; and social media reports on the ground indicated at the time that Uber drivers were rolling right through the boycott, picking up passengers and not showing solidarity with their taxi counterparts against Trump.

And now, it looks like Uber is going to pay for it &#8212; HARD. 
First, it came in the form of a very public boycott of the company on social media, just some of which you can see (below):

I switched from @Uber to @Lyft a while ago!! #DeleteUber https://t.co/SYD947Vn3C

Hey @Uber my favorite part of today was deleting my UBER account and signing up for @lyft #notmyliberalpennies #girlbye #deleteuber

Support #lyft for supporting American values. #deleteuber

WOW!!! 
And it gets even better &#8212; because Lyft responded in the best, most American way.

Here's an email titled "Defending our values" that they sent out to all customers early Sunday morning (below): 
"This weekend, Trump closed the country's borders to refugees, immigrants, and even documented residents from around the world based on their country of origin. Banning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U.S. is antithetical to both Lyft's and our nation's core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community. 
"We know this directly impacts many of our community members, their families, and friends. We stand with you, and are donating $1,000,000 over the next four years to the ACLU to defend our constitution. We ask that you continue to be there for each other - and together, continue proving the power of community. 
John &#038; Logan 
Lyft Co-Founders" 
Incredible!!! 
That is a ONE MILLION DOLLAR donation from the Lyft folks over the course of four years &#8212; a truly impressive achievement! We absolutely love it!!

CoverGirl's First Male Brand Ambassador Gets The Whole Company In Trouble With Ignorant Africa Tweet!  
CoverGirl may have hit a slight speed bump with their first CoverBoy. 
Just last October, James Charles made headlines when he was named the first male brand ambassador for the the female-named company.

But the 17-year-old beauty vlogger's spokesperson status may be in jeopardy thanks to a Twitter joke that wasn't exactly what one looks for in a spokesperson. 
Commenting on his feelings about a class trip to South Africa, James wrote in a now-deleted Tweet:
