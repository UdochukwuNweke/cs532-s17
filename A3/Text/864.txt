Ryan Farmer on Nottingham &amp; Derby Roots Radio 
Ryan Farmer 
Ryan Farmer is an Americana singer songwriter hailing from Nottingham, UK. Taking influence from the blues of the Mississippi Delta, the traditional folk of the Appalachian Mountains and the honky tonk from a Texas bar room, prepare for songs to make you dance, drink, cry and praise the lord in the space of a few minutes. 
After the success of his debut Worries &amp; Troubles in 2014 ( I’m Not From London Records ), Ryan is back with more tales of whiskey, women and worry with his 2nd EP ‘Lurch.’ With his unique blend of gospel, country and blues, Ryan’s music has been praised across the midlands for the last two years. 
Ryan will definitely win you over he’s exceptional and roots acoustic evening will always be a big fan

Being best known for writing his songs single-handed, and composing them almost entirely on a solitary basis, you will often see him performing with just himself and his guitar. 
As a diverse, acoustic artist, whom of which performs in various venues across the country – especially in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire – David experiments with pop and folk genres to create his own contemporary masterpieces.
