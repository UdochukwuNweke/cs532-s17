This Rapper Made An Entire Song Only Using The Word "Aye" 
Eric Isom           
Jan 30, 2017 
One of the main criticisms of the new generation of rappers today is that it&#39;s all repetitive "mumble rap." The ad-lib heavy tracks confuse and infuriate many of the traditional rap fans, most of the complaints are like "All he&#39;s saying is "yeah yeah yeah" or "aye aye aye."  
Of course that has never really been the case, until today. 
Wisconsin rapper Syringe has taken things to the next level and literally made a song where all he says is "Aye!" There&#39;s not much explaining to do, for a little over two minutes over super hard production, you hear the popular ad-lib over and over, and over again.  
Check it out above. 
Syringe also makes a ton of music where he says more than "Aye," check him out in our 5 Artists That Will Make Your Ears Bleed P&P Update below
