You can turn off images appearing in the body of an article by going to Settings, Under the Syncing heading you will see 'Images in Articles'. If you turn this on the images will then appear as thumbnails at the end of the article.

I only have limited high speed data and I do not wish to have it used up by anything I do not choose for myself. Too bad because I really enjoyed the mix of articles, gossip and headlines and tons of random, interesting articles plus great photos. Daily Mail, please make an option to turn off autoplay video so I can install and enjoy your otherwise fantastic app again!!!  Full Review            Bill bank  December 18, 2016              Adverts and forced videos getting in the way Was a good free news resource with the occasional advert to pay it's way, but recently the non stop adverts and forced videos have wrecked it. In particular you can not stop or skip the forced video adverts. App now deleted from my phone. Ps. I see many other people are leaving similar one or two star reviews about the ads, but also a lot of 5 star no word and anonymous rating are now being added.  Full Review            Karen Nolen  October 15, 2016              It used to be news When I first started reading them online they had actual unbiased news. Have had the app for years but now it's turned into everything except news. Most articles are made up or pulled from other sites like Reddit. The journalists copy the work of others without any fact checking, and the writing is deplorable (basic grammar issues, words missing). The arrows are fixed - when you comment on an article, how does someone get 20k arrows in 10 minutes?  Full Review            Abel Tapia  December 6, 2016              Lots of news! The sync option is great when you want to read articles in the subway. Other than that, it's a great looking app with all sorts of news you can customize to your interests. Only one minor complaint is that recent updates seem to be impacting the battery more than previous builds.  Full Review            Brian Lopez  October 2, 2016              Could be better Since ive had this app there are plenty of days when i does not want to load articles, freezes or just simply does not respond. I love daily mail. Ive used it diligently since i heard my favorite talk show host rush Limbaugh talk of it. Its a great app dont get me wrong. It just all too often doesnt load articles I want to read  Full Review            Lady Lbrty  August 30, 2016              I gave this such a poor review because I can't read the headlines on the stories! There is two different kinds of writing and they're on top of each other making it impossible to know what the story is about without clicking on it and going to the story's main page! Then I can read it. So I have judge whether a story is newsworthy based on a thumbnail pic! Please fix this, I like the app and would rate 5 stars if I could read the captions on the main page. I hope this made sense.  Full Review            Beth Richardson  September 24, 2016              Adds are ridiculous Used to spend all day on this app but the adds have made it insufferable. You try and read a 'story' (can't really call them news articles with grammar that poor) and you get taken to the app store. Try and leave that and it brings up another app to try and make you download, then another, when I finally got back to the app it flashed up a spam add! Deleting  Full Review            Georgia Kelley  December 1, 2016              Love this app! Update to original rating: since the last update there are a lot more ads. some pop up out of nowhere and I think the ads are freezing up the app and I have to close it and go back in so that it works again. I still love this app and use it more than any other app. just wish it wouldn't freeze up so often. I love that it pre loads the articles so that i can read them even when service is unavailable or out of range. It even has videos now!  Full Review    Daily Mail Online January 27, 2014 Thanks for the positive feedback, Georgia. We're glad you're enjoying the app.            August 26, 2016              Good except world news not updated frequently I like the offline feature which allows me to read the news while I don't have internet connection, such as during a cruise. However not all the news are downloaded and the world news is usually a day or two late even though it says all my favorites are up to date :(  Full Review            Jagz  September 16, 2016              Stupid Ads Hate these stupid spam ads popping up all the time, soon as you look at a picture her this irritating pop up ad. Most the time can't even click back, forced to view it all then click the "x". Used to be an awesome app until this happened. Will be deleting this &amp; using something else. Shame  Full Review            Clear Vision  September 24, 2016              Too many intrusive ads overtaking the stories and trying to make me download a poxy app This app is now ridiculously full of ads. They over take a story you are reading to divert you to the app store to download a poxy game. Its so bad ive now uninstalled the app. Thats before i start on the terrible writing and the bad mistakes. Most stories lifted from american or foreign sites and will have their slang and currency. The stories will always have a paragraph repeated at least once in the story. Crap app now i came here from the sky app as that went the same way with ads.  Full Review            Cheryl S  December 21, 2016              Ok Adverts are a pain when you click on comments and when looking at photos. They seem to be endless now. Wish there was a way you could get straight back to your own comment rather than going through hundreds to try and find it. In the end i give up.  Full Review            Janet Kingdon  August 25, 2016              Totally messed up the update is NOT an improvement. It's much slower, forcing me to view sections I don't want to see. I'll be deleting and going to another newspaper for my news. One star rating.  Update: August 2016. After having to uninstall and reinstall daily to get it to update, switching to single news feed has solved the problem. So now a 4 star rating ... still down one as comments don't always load.  Full Review    Daily Mail Online February 17, 2016 We've listened. Please update the app and you'll be able to change the layout under 'Settings - Channel Layout - Single Channel'. If you're happy after upgrading, we hope you'll reconsider your * star review.

It's not the same now they force adverts on you. They keep popping up and it's very irritating. I'd happily pay a small fee to go advert free but this isn't an option. Sadly, after using for many years, going to delete this app and use BBC and RT news instead.  Full Review            Adam Johnson  November 14, 2016              Simply Outrageous The Daily Mail have gone from pushing a dangerous political agenda to swinging at anyone who criticises them, as shown by their piece about Planet Earth 2 this morning, where, whilst attempting to rage against Sir David Attenborough, instead seem to be criticising both the concept of narrative and the existence of nature simultaneously. I thought I could no longer be surprised by this "newspaper". I was wrong.  Full Review            Bobby Nelson  February 4, 2017              Some of the worst writing ever, they must not have editors or spell check, but it's still very addictive &amp; a place where I can find news that sources in the US refuse to publish &amp; it sections off most of the crap celebrity "news," which is a huge bonus. My only complaints, besides the writing, are the intrusive ads, ads for cults like Scientology and Scamway and that it seems to eat up my battery. Otherwise, this is one of my favorite apps. Update: Uninstalled, switched to web version, most problems solved!  Full Review            roxy rose  November 16, 2016              Great way to kill time I enjoy all the choices of articles from femail, to health, to UK news and so on. But most enjoyable is reading people's comments and opinions and havin your own and others agreeing or not. It's a shame in the celebrity articles Kardashian are topic of the day ever Day!!!  Full Review            Mike Cook  August 29, 2016              Run by MUFC fans!!!! Joke of a News app. Just had an email through to say my comment has been removed due to a number of complaints made!. All I said was who I think will finish top four this season in the premiership. No sweat words or anything threatening and the Mail online removed it. This isn't the first time this has happened where I have commented and had it removed due to a number of complaints even though no swear words or threatening words have been used. Emailed them a number of times with no reply. Very poor.  Full Review            Stephen Riddell  January 10, 2017              Used to be the best but ads have ruined it. Back when news apps were in their infancy, DM was the best: a little thumbnail, a headline, and a little text to get you interested, all in a row, with loads of rows down the page and a swipe left or right to change topic area. Now everyone is doing it. DM is now plagued with ads which open the app store and invite you to install something you don't want in a loop. Some ads even sound an alarm: that goes down really well in the silent carriage. I'm deleting this app.  Full Review            Craig Dunne  December 15, 2016              Disgrace. This app used to be insightful and usable. Now. With adverts in every article and video adverts It has become so unbearable to use it is just a despicable heap of junk. As if your profits where not high enough already you have decided to further destroy the app, a combination of terrible spelling and adverts have ruined this. Well don't mail. Well done.  Full Review            Brittany Smith  January 17, 2017              My Favorite My favorite news app. The articles are written for people who want to keep up with what's going on in general but also don't want to be bored to death with the super serious monotonous writing found elsewhere. I find it interesting also you guys get pretty accurate stories out faster than most as well.  Full Review            Matt Drew  September 13, 2016              Spam Web popups I get keeping spam Web popups recently. Time to uninstall. Also they have started forcing you to watch ads.. Even in the video and all you can do is turn the sound off... can't be bothered anymore... I'm off to sky news...  Full Review            Matthew Jones  February 12, 2017              Just when you thought you couldn't get any worse than the ads before videos they go and put them as pop ups now. This with constant adds popping up all over the place and it's just a money making app for the paper now. It's getting deleated. Used to enjoy the comments mind.  Full Review    Daily Mail Online February 13, 2017 Please upgrade the app, we have many improvements with the newer build           susan dunne  August 18, 2016              Spam Web browser pop ups Each time I am on the app today, I keep getting redirected to a Web browser page and it's a ring tone subscription company displaying. It doesn't happen on any other app or while browsing. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still happening. It's happening to my partner as well.  Full Review            Damian Kuczera  September 21, 2016              Too Many Adverts This is a great app but the adverts make it unusable. Having to watch the same 30 second ad a dozen times repeatedly on every article video is ridiculous. Most sites manage to not serve the same adverts when you have watched them and 30 seconds is far too long, maybe the initial advert could be 30 seconds but these adverts are adding about 5 minutes to my morning news session. Not happy!  Full Review            Mark Newman  October 6, 2016              The new version is crap. The latest iteration of the Daily Mail app is horrible. (October 2016) It's too complicated to navigate and impossible to sign in. A lot more intrusive ads, too. Add to that, the stories are getting more and more like The Sun or The Inquirer! Nobody has thought this through at all.  Full Review            Biancha  September 27, 2016              Great apart from the ads I've used this app for a number of years, and it has always been very good, but the ads are now a joke. They pop up after viewing every other photo. Any chance we could have the option to pay to remove the ads?  Full Review            Milind J  September 21, 2016              Fake baseless news ...
