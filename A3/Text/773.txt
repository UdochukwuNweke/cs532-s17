South Alabama landed a pair of 2017 commitments from defensive backs over the weekend. 
Cornerback Devin Rockette of Oxford, Miss., committed to the Jaguars on Saturday, followed by safety A.J. Deshazor of Lakeland, Fla., on Sunday. Both players are rated 3-star prospects according to 247 Sports composite. 
The 5-foot-11, 165-pound Rockette was at one time committed to Ole Miss. He also had offers from Florida Atlantic and Delta State. 
Deshazor (6-0, 185) also had offers from FAU, Indiana, Louisville and Virginia Tech, among other schools. He played linebacker at Lake Gibson High School, but is expected to be a safety or nickel back in college. 
The Jaguars now have 10 verbal commitments for 2017, not counting junior-college running back Tywun Walters, who enrolled in December. South Alabama has only 11 scholarships to offer in the 2017 class after signing 14 blue shirts last summer. 
Rockette and Deshazor give the Jaguars four 3-star commitments for 2017, joining Murphy linebacker Kendric Haynes and Saraland cornerback Wydale Flott. National signing day is Wednesday. 
The commitments of Rockette and Deshazor were first reported by JagsJungle.com. 
On Sunday night, Flott announced via Twitter that he was sticking with his commitment to USA. "Thanks to all the universities for the opportunities they have given me But I'm ending my recruitment and 100% committed to south Alabama!" 
However, at some point Flott deleted that tweet and posted two photos of his weekend visit to Florida Atlantic, including one photo showing him with FAU head coach Lane Kiffin.
