Trump Blasts McCain and Graham as &#8216;Always Looking to Start WW III&#8217; 
Kristinn Taylor  Jan 29th, 2017 4:21 pm  Leave a Comment   President Donald Trump blasted Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) as war mongers in response to their criticism, made in a joint statement, of his executive order restricting immigration from several terrorist hot spot nations.

Trump posted to his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account Sunday afternoon: 
&#8220;The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain &#038; Lindsey Graham is wrong &#8211; they are sadly weak on immigration. The two&#8230;&#8230;Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.&#8221;

&#8230;Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. 
&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 
CNBC reported on the statement by McCain and Graham: 
&#8220;It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump&#8217;s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security,&#8221; said the two centrist Republicans in a joint statement. 
McCain and Graham said that &#8220;such a hasty process risks harmful results,&#8221; criticizing the order for causing detentions of legal permanent residents and refugees who were already vetted by the government. 
The senators said that they fear it will become a &#8220;self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.&#8221; 
&#8220;This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,&#8221; McCain and Graham said.&#8221;
