Even green card and visa-holding citizens won't be allowed unto the US under new rule 
Rihanna has responded to Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order to ban immigrants and refugees from seven countries in what he says is a bid to stop terrorists from entering the US. 
On Friday (January 27), he signed an order putting a four-month hold on allowing anyoneÂ into the United States who is from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia and Libya. Even those holding valid green cards and visas issued by the US or who have dual citizenship with another country not on the list will not be allowed entry to the country under Trump&#8217;s new rule. 
The order has caused uproar across the US with protestors descending on major airports such as New York&#8217;s JFK airport and O&#8217;Hare International in Chicago. 
Many stars from across the music and entertainment world have taken to Twitter to express anger and disgust at the move from the new President, who was sworn in just last Friday (January 20). 
Rihanna wrote on her account: &#8220;Disgusted! The news is devastating! America is being ruined right before our eyes! What an immoral pig you have to be to implement such BS!!&#8221;

John Legend also commented on the order while introducing a clip fromÂ  La La Land at the Producers Guild Of America awards last night (January 28), asÂ  The Hollywood Reporter reports. 
&#8220;Los Angeles is the home of so many immigrants, so many creative people, so many dreamers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions. Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.&#8221; 
Legend&#8217;s wife, model Chrissy Teigen, also gave her views on Twitter. She wrote: &#8220;Donald Trump is an unwell, evil human being. To the core.&#8221;

I actually literally CANNOT think think of a time where I&#39;ve been so overwhelmed with sadness, anger and disgust at a person, his team and their supporters. What happened today to people who WORKED and PROTECTED US forces in Iraq and elsewhere and were already vetted to the highest level, literally makes me sick. It takes a truly cold and evil heart to close the door on the most needy, not to mention people who HELPED US. Shame on this man, and anyone who supports/supported him. Truly truly truly a dark chapter in our history. #istandwithrefugees #istandwithplannedparenthood #notmypresident #shame ps. Hi @ivankatrump , you follow me! What is wrong with you ? Honestly how can you sit by why all this is happening. SHAME

Steve Jobs father was Syrian and he was adopted in to an American family. This is absolute madness and completely against American interest

The order has now been blocked by a federal judge, but the ACLU is reporting customs agents are still imposing the ban.
