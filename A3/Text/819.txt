Branislav Ivanovic set to join Zenit, Odion Ighalo on his way to China 
Gab Marcotti assesses some rumoured moves around football, including the possibility of Alvaro Morata joining Arsenal. 
The winter transfer window is now in full swing! As usual, Transfer Talk has its finger on the pulse when it comes to which rumours are picking up steam. Check out all the latest deals here . 
TOP STORY: Ivanovic closes on Zenit, Ighalo to China 
Branislav Ivanovic is set to complete his move from Chelsea to Zenit St Petersburg, Sky Sports claims, with just personal terms all that needs to be sorted. 
Ivanovic had also been linked with a switch to West Brom but Baggies boss Tony Pulis ruled out any move involving his club , while Chelsea manager Antonio Conte confirmed his player is considering an offer to depart Stamford Bridge. 
That offer is from Russian club Zenit, says Sky Sports, which reports that the Blues defender will seal the switch in the next 24 hours. 
Meanwhile, Odion Ighalo is also reportedly set to depart the Premier League before the transfer deadline, with China the Watford striker's destination. 
According to Sky Sports , Watford have agreed a &#163;20 million fee with Chinese club Chongchun Yatai for Ighalo, with the Hornets looking to cash in on a player who has only scored one league goal all season.

After the Mirror reported that a move to Bournemouth is drawing closer for Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic -- as long as the Londoners bring in a replacement -- Sky Sports says the Blues' pursuit of Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is ongoing. 
Craig Gordon remains on Chelsea's radar -- and if he arrives, Asmir Begovic is set to leave. 
Begovic, who played against Brentford in the FA Cup, has no regrets about joining Chelsea but is desperate to get back to playing first-team football. 
And he could soon do just that, with Sky reporting that the Blues "have launched a second bid, of &#163;4 million, for Gordon after having an initial offer rejected on Friday." 
Celtic, the defending champions and runaway leaders of the Scottish Premiership, have said they want the goalkeeper to stay and sign a new contract. 
Saints close in on Napoli striker 
Cometh the hour, cometh the Manolo? The Mirror thinks so, reporting that Southampton feel they can wrap up a &#163;17 million deal for Napoli striker Manolo Gabbiadini before Tuesday night. 
Southampton are inching closer to a deal for Napoli striker Manolo Gabbiadini, according to reports. 
The Saints want to offer Gabbiadini, 24, a four-year deal that would put an end to Everton's interest in the player who stretches back to last summer's window. 
The Mirror says the Italy international remains a target for "a number of Premier League clubs," but EFL Cup finalists Saints are now at the front of the queue. 
Foxes hunt double deal 
Champions Leicester City are hopeful that they can wrap up moves for Middlesbrough's Gaston Ramirez and defender Kara Mbodji of Anderlecht before the bell tolls for the end of the window, according to the Leicester Mercury . 
It reports that although the Foxes have seen bids for both players turned down, they are "prepared to go down to the wire to land their targets." 
Ramirez has submitted a transfer request in an effort to secure a switch to the King Power, but the Mercury reports that move will only happen if the northeast club can bring in a replacement. 
Leicester, however, "remain confident a deal with Boro can be done, possibly even on Monday." 
ESPN FC's Gab Marcotti has his finger on the pulse of all the latest transfer news ahead of Tuesday's deadline. 
Tap-ins 
- Leeds United fans could do with a fillip after the shock FA Cup defeat to non-league Sutton United, and the man to provide it looks like being West Ham United striker Ashley Fletcher, says the Mail . 
It reports that the former Manchester United player is likely to be heading to Elland Road on loan after starting only three games for the Hammers this season. 
Fletcher, the Mail adds, "is keen to join a club of Leeds' standing and to play regularly," with the move likelier to go through if and when West Ham complete their protracted pursuit of Brentford's Scott Hogan . 
- Middlesbrough were one of several clubs interested in signing Hull City's Robert Snodgrass , but having missed out on him, they are turning their attentions to Fulham midfielder Tom Cairney . 
The Sun says Cairney is now the top target for Boro boss Aitor Karanka, who is "attempting to seal a &#163;7 million deal for the former Blackburn player," with officials at the Riverside Stadium hopeful a deal can go through.
