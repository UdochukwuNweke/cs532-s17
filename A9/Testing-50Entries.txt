This Week: Sun, Sea & Tapas <> Thursday marked the first time this year that I've dared to venture out of the house minus a jacket. Hooray! Although after hopping on a train to Brighton the decision was soon being regretted - you can always count on the sea breeze to be absolutely freezing, no matter how sunny it looks! My wardrobe has been completely overtaken by black at the moment, even this white cardigan from Miss Selfridge is a rare diversion from my standard colour palette! I'm also absolutely smitten with these lace up flats from Next. Last time I checked they were sold out - boo! But I've seen different versions popping up everywhere from Topshop to Office. After snapping a few outfit photos which at one point had Suzie sitting bare legged on a stone wall - that girl's a trooper, we headed into the laines for Tapas at Solera. I honestly could have ordered plate after plate it was so good, the 'patatas' and baked goats cheese were especially on point, if you're in Brighton I definitely recommend a visit and we even had the whole place to ourselves despite being in the middle of half term - cue shameless instagramming and hours of chatting! <> style
Five Years of Topshop Beauty <> It's been five years this month since Topshop took their first steps into the world of beauty with their very own make up line, and I've been continually impressed with the collections, colours and products in general since my very first purchase - which definitely doesn't feel like that long ago! From the blushers that I owned in just about every colour to the nail polishes - always on trend shades that you just can't seem to find anywhere else, there's just something undeniably cool about Topshop make up, and to celebrate the anniversary the now iconic spotty black and white packaging of some of their best loved products has been given a rose gold upgrade.  I've always been inspired by the Topshop beauty campaigns - fresh faced girls with glowing skin that's never overdone, simple eye looks and always a gorgeous lip colour. One particular look that always sticks in my mind from SS13 had all of the above, topped off with the model's freckles shining through, which as a documented freckle lover I really couldn't get enough of! After starting with a light base mixed with one of Topshop's most versatile products, Glow to some added radiance, I bronzed my skin up with the Matte Bronzer in Mohawke* and added a warm iridescent sheen to my cheeks with the Highlighter in Horizon*. Eyes were a simple sweep of Nude Eyes Cream Shadow in Naked* all over the lid with a flick of Magic Liner, which with a skinny nib and intense black formula has sent it right to the top of my liner loves list, followed by lashings of Doe Eyed Mascara*. Lips were a very Summer appropriate soft orange which I created by tapping in Infrared* with my fingers and blotting away. Not forgetting the all important faux freckles which I sketched on lightly with the two toned Freckle Pencil - probably the best product ever created for giving a realistic spattering of sun kissed beauty spots. Topshop are also giving away ten sets of the products I used! Just follow me on Twitter and retweet this tweet to be in with the chance of winning! <> beauty
Cherry Blossoms & Tulle <> Bare legs alert! My pasty pins made their first outing of the year last month and I really couldn't be happier about it - although a quick once over with some fake tan wouldn't have hurt! Team that fresh Summer feeling with a frolic in the cherry blossoms - which have already faded by now much to my Instagram feed's disappointment, and you've got a recipe for a style post.  This Alexandra Grecco number is basically the skirt dreams are made of, layer upon layer of gorgeous tulle that ultimately lead me to pulling on a pair of heels (although these Kurt Geiger boots are about as high as it gets for me!) and having a small 'I'm Carrie Bradshaw moment' while posing in front of a busy road and a row of houses - not quite the glamorous NYC life in my case! The leather jacket really has been my staple wardrobe piece of the moment, where it's a little too cold to go coatless but too hot to wear anything thick. I'm always on the hunt for the perfect biker style (finding the right leather jacket for you is definitely akin to finding true love) and this one from River Island fits the bill pretty well, adding enough edge to an outfit like this to stop me feeling like a fairy in a tutu! <> style
Current Skincare Favourites & Morning/Evening Routine <> Skincare, skincare, skincare. Let's talk about skincare! I feel like I've been dying to make this video for so long, as - come on, it's just the best subject to talk about. From it's importance as a foundation for make up to discovering new exciting ingredients and building up a routine there's just no end the amount I could go on about skincare! Luckily for you though, I've condensed about an hour's worth of rambling into one bite-size chunk to digest today, chatting through my current favourites of the moment, some new additions and how they all fit into my morning and evening routines. <> beauty
April Favourites <> Time for another dose of favourites, coming to you from the month of April! Side note - how on earth have we ended up in May so fast, I've been helplessly singing 'N Sync like there's no tomorrow. Although not the best month for beauty - I feel like I've spent more days out of make up than wearing it, I've got a handful of products that still managed to wow me, including a foundation that I haven't stopped raving about since it's first use and and hair washing duo from the drugstore that are giving a high end favourite a run for it's money! <> misc
This Week: A Magical Disney Weekend! <> Happy Sunday everyone! This week has definitely been one I'd rather forget, but I had so much fun putting this vlog together from our time at Dinsey last weekend that it managed to put a smile back on my face. Darren and I are already planning a return visit - Christmas in Paris is something that I desperately want to experience, so fingers crossed we'll have that to look forward to! Until then this vlog will have to suffice in keeping the magic alive, and it really was one of the most magical places I've ever visited. From the rides, to the big pink castle and the amazing show each night (seriously, you can't miss this - i absolutely bawled!) everything was perfect and the inner child inside both of us absolutely loved it! <> lifestyle
I Went to Sephora and Only Bought One Thing <>  This weekend I found myself in the the beauty lover's heaven that is Sephora, and on the Champs-Élysées in Paris no less - cue angels singing. I've always been incredibly jealous of those lucky enough to have a store in your own backyard - all the best brands in one black and white stripy space, and lets not forget the adorable minis on offer. Believe it or not though despite spending over an hour in there (much to Darren's disapproval) I only picked up one thing for myself! I've had the Sephora Cream Lip Stain in Always Red on my mind for some time now but held off until I could swatch it in person, because - let's be honest, do I really need to add another red liquid lipstick to my collection? The answer this time was an absolute yes. This really is a true cool toned red, something I surprisingly don't own in this type of formula and the application and finish are the closest thing I've ever felt to velvet on my lips. The colour is rich and hangs around for the entire day but feels comfortable enough for you to forget it's even there. I may have had to go all the way to Paris for it, but as an all-year-round red lip lover it was definitely worth it. Now, had this been a visit to a US Sephora, things would have been quite a different story - I'm not sure they make a big enough bag to hold the amount of products I'd be wanting to purchase, with the likes of Tarte, Make Up Forever and Josie Marran taunting me from afar. Fingers crossed though, I may not have to wait long to start throwing them into my basket - watch this space! <> misc
Boots Beaty Haul & First Impressions <> It's pretty much a guarantee that I'll be making a big splurge in Boots around this time of year. The Sun comes out, blossoms are on the trees and drugstore brands start dropping their Spring releases which never fail to catch my eye. Cue a haul! This one comes with a bit of twist as I throw just about everything I bought straight onto my face and share my first impressions with you, including a new foundation love, a mascara that I was less than impressed with and a few interesting dupes for some higher end favourites! <>  misc
This Week: Bonjour Paris! <> Bonjour from Paris! On Friday morning - at 4am no less (snore!), we were up and heading to the airport for a weekend of fun at Disney! I think early flight times are definitely the way to go for plane-phobes like myself as I spent most of the hour long journey more concerned with going back to sleep than the fact that I was a thousand feet up in the air. The last two days have been spent wandering around the parks, practically bursting into tears every time I see the castle and wearing a ridiculous set of Mini Mouse ears like they're going out of style. Today though we're off into the city and I've got my heart set on making my way up the Eiffel Tower, third time lucky!  On a more personal note, you may have noticed a little silence on the content front this week, including missing last Sunday's video and although I absolutely hate to let you down when it comes to uploads, I've had a bit of a tough week after losing a very special family member only a few days ago. I wanted to say a quick little thank you for all the lovely messages I received throughout the week, your kindness and concern never ceases to amaze me and every little tweet, email and heart emoji helps. Wishing you the loveliest of weekends and see you back in England! <> lifestyle
Budget Dupes & Drugstore Beauty Alternatives <> There's something incredibly satisfying about finding budget dupes for some of the most coveted high end products out there, especially when they come in at less than half the price of the originals with little difference in formula, colour and packaging. This week I've picked out some of my favourite drugstore alternatives that in most cases match up almost identically with their luxury counterparts and a few that I actually prefer! <> misc
Nutella Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookies <> Happy Easter everyone! I hope you've already found yourself in a full fledged chocolate induced coma on the sofa, but if not I've got a super easy recipe thats guaranteed to get you there! Usually I'd stick to a healthier kind of treat (see my post on some good-for-you alternatives here) but as we find ourselves quite literally surrounded by chocolate, what better time to indulge than now! Nutella will always be a life long love of mine and what better way to spice up a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe than by adding a generous scoop of liquid brown gold in the centre. The ingredients are listed below and it's pretty much a case of throwing everything together in a bowl, creating a little Nutella parcel to achieve that gooey surprise inside and baking for 10-15 minutes at 180°c. Last week I roped Suzie in to help me whisk up a batch if you want to see the whole process in action, plus the ensuing hilarity that generally happens when we get together. We also filmed a Q&A on Suzie's channel which makes for perfect viewing while you're waiting for your cookies to bake! INGREDIENTS: 220g Unsalted Butter 3/4 cup Soft Brown Sugar 1 cup White Caster Sugar 2 Eggs 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 3 1/2 cups Plain Flour 1 pinch of Salt 1 tsp Baking Soda Chocolate Chips 6 - 10 scoops of Nutella  Mini Eggs and any other treats you fancy throwing in!  Happy baking! <> misc
I Covet Thee Turns Four! <> Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me! Four years ago this week I opened my laptop, created a blogger account and proceeded to spend the next eight hours (in which I should have been sleeping) creating I Covet Thee. I kid you not - Darren left me on the sofa, went to bed and woke up to find me in the exact same position frantically typing away, trying to wade my way through the daunting world of HTML. Four years on my coding knowledge may not have progressed past changing font colours and adding pictures, but to my absolute amazement I Covet Thee has surpassed any expectations I ever had when typing in those three little words in 'blog title' all those years ago. It shocks and humbles me to see that there are now over 100,000 of you following this little space - believe me, I checked and double checked that figure too when I saw it surpass the six digit mark on Bloglovin' and even though I'd be happy just rambling away to one person who was willing listen to me chat about mascara and ambient lighting powders, I can't thank you all enough for supporting I Covet Thee and allowing me to turn a hobby into a career with so many incredible opportunities. In the past year alone I've managed to meet and get to know some of the people that have been inspiring me since this all started, made a new friend for life and even travelled to Paris - the most beautiful city in the world, all thanks to you! So here's to the next four years, and the rest. This is only the beginning! <> lifestyle
March Favourites <> So this post is almost a week overdue (although I was convince I'd already written it.. where is my mind!?) but I thought I'd update you all anyway as what better way to spend a rather gloomy Wednesday afternoon (Spring, see you soon?) than catching up on a new monthly favourites video! March's picks are another short and sweet bunch, but a good lot nonetheless. Some new skincare additions have finally trickled their way into my regular routine and a I'm having a moment with all things light, sheer and dewy in the make up department! <> misc
My Everyday Make Up Bag & Routine <>  Since the last update on my current picks for everyday make up was all the way back in Autumn - my how time flies, and as I'm no longer craving full coverage foundations and berry lips (and for that matter dark colours and warm layers) I thought we were about due a revisit of my go-to look. Instead it's a lighter hand and more glow inducing products that I've been cramming into my make up bag, and this month it's all about keeping to subtle shades and soft blending, while not forgetting the necessary slick of liquid liner that I've been all about recently and some seriously plumped up lashes. Natural skin meets defined eyes, think of it as the 5:2 approach to make up! <> misc
This Week: Charlotte Tilbury X Norman Parkinson <> Last week I definitely had one of those surreal 'pinch me' moments when I found myself not only sitting in the same room as a handful of blogging babes that I've been reading and looking up to for years - but also, at the head of a perfectly decorated table, Charlotte Tilbury. It's days like this that really have me thanking my lucky stars that my blog has come from posting pictures of Subway cookies and Friends quotes to something that has allowed me to meet one of me absolute idols. Gushing aside, we were there to preview Charlotte's SS15 collaboration with Norman Parkinson, renowned fashion photographer and the king of vintage Vogue covers. The four piece collection features a gorgeous cream version of the famous Film Star Bronze & Glow, a dewey, brightening Colour of Youth cream blush and a highlighting powder that I'm pretty much planning on marrying, as well as a make up bag (which I'm already making full use off, as seen in today's video), all packaged in beautiful rose gold compacts printed with some of Parkinson's most iconic images. Unfortunately the collection doesn't land in stores until July which right now seems ridiculously far in the distance - although I know it'll be here before we know it, so expect to see a more detailed review closer to the time! I also vlogged most of the day, which included catching up with Suzie, a naughty Zara purchase and a Nutella filled cookie that left us both drooling, plus a mini hair transformation that happened later in the week, which can all be seen here! <> lifestyle
The Best Budget Micellar Water <> Probably the only thing more satisfying than stepping away from the mirror, make up routine complete, liquid liner flicks symmetrical, is the moment at the end of the day when it comes to taking it all off again. A fresh face after clocking a few hours of make up wear-time is just about the most freeing feeling ever, but when it comes down to the actual process of removal I'm ashamed to say that I've been known to put it off for as long as possible to avoid the hassle of reaching for the series of different steps needed to break those layers down. This is where I turn to micellar waters - I'd be willing to bet my mascara collection that there's now a bottle of the stuff and a stash of cotton pads hiding away in nearly every room of my flat for such times when I'm craving a make up free face, so it goes without saying I get through the stuff pretty quickly. Luckily for my bank balance, these days there are a whole host of budget friendly options available on the high street and after trying just about all of them I have to say it's the Nivea Sensitive 3-in-1 Cleansing Water that comes out on top. Aside from the fact that this really does remove make up like no other - one soaked cotton pad per eye, held on gently for a few seconds has you covered for melting away every scrap of mascara, shadow and tough-to-budge liquid liner (Stila All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner, I'm looking at you), it's also so gentle and kind to my skin.  Stressed out skin and sensitivity is something I'm having to deal with on a day to day basis at the moment (let's say one too many episodes of The Walking Dead before bed isn't helping my levels of calm) and the cooling formula of the cleansing water works perfectly to soothe away any redness or irritation, especially as it's free of perfumes, parabens, alcohol and all those nasties! Best of all though, being infused with grape seed oil it actually leaves my skin feeling plumped, fresh and hydrated, giving me the time to potter around without any uncomfortable feeling of tightness while I give my skin a chance to breath before continuing with the rest of my routine.  For me it really does tick all the boxes when it comes to finding the perfect micellar water. Super speedy to use, amazing removal power and kind to my skin all at the same time! Plus, the budget price really comes in handy with my quest to fill every available corner with a bottle of make up remover! <> beauty
This Week: The South's Best Mac & Cheese <> Another Sunday, another trip to The Tenth Hole in Southsea followed by a few hours spent in the inevitable food coma. This time we went for the savoury option (although a slice of cake may have made it onto our plates later on..) and probably the best mac & cheese I've ever eaten - gooey, cheesy, carb loaded goodness which was definitely worth the fifteen minute wait in the cold you're likely to find most weekends. After a start to the week that, lets be honest, mostly revolved around food, the next few days turned into a bit of a whirlwind after finally tackling a backlog of blog posts that I've been meaning to get out for weeks - expect to see more regular content soon! On Thursday I found myself on the 10:30 train to London where, after a quick rendezvous with Suzie, I got the chance to preview Charlotte Tilbury's latest collection in collaboration with Norman Parkinson - details to follow next week! For now though I'll be spending the rest of the weekend at home with family and a box of Maltesers that, although intended as a Mother's day gift, I'll no doubt be polishing off myself around the time this post goes live.. I hope you and your Mums are all having a lovely day! <> lifestyle
This Week: The South's Best Mac & Cheese <> Like most hauls, this one started off with a single innocent purchase that spiralled into a full fledged raid of Space NK - once again confirming the fact that I should not be allowed into that store unsupervised. The newest drop from NARS in the form of their All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation (which F.Y.I I'm loving at the moment) may have been the only thing I planned on purchasing last month, but like a moth to a flame I was drawn in by the likes of By Terry, Laura Mercier and Hourglass as well. Oh how easily I can be swayed by shiny gold packaging... <> misc
February Favourites <> I get tired of saying this nearly every month, but February really has flown by. Spring is definitely in the air and I'm finally starting to shake that Winter feeling that's been with me since Christmas. The (ever so slightly) warmer weather is not only brightening my mood, but it's also increased my productivity levels - hopefully you should be seeing at least two videos a week from me in March, woo! Back to February though and as with last month's favourites I've kept things short and sweet with just a handful of the best products that have been making their way into my beauty routine on a daily basis, including a set of beautiful rose gold brushes that won't break the bank, a few Spring launches that I've been devouring and a budget micellar water that may just live up to the likes of Bioderma! <> misc
Hair Chat: Favourite Products & Styling Routine <> An updated hair routine has been long overdue for some time now, as not only have my cut and colour changed dramatically from the last instalment, but my styling process too. I've stripped down the amount of products I was using and now stick to the key items that generally revolve the big four - shampoo, conditioner, a treatment and one styling product, and honestly my hair's never been happier. I've also thrown in a little how-to using the GHD Curve Classic Wave Wand - my new favourite heat tool, which is the closest thing I've ever found to achieving the tousled, Olsen-esque locks that I've always dreamt of! <> misc
Topshop, Asos & Missguided Haul <> Over the last few weeks I've been giving my wardrobe a bit of an overhaul and after accumulating quite a few new items - from basics to one rather large investment piece, a haul was definitely in order! February is always an awkward month for style. The weather is still bitterly cold making layers and thick knits a necessity but with Spring just around the corner it's hard not to find yourself yearning for bright colours, sheer materials and lighter coats. Today's haul is the best of both with Winter staples contributing to the bulk of my picks but a few warm weather appropriate pieces making an appearance too! <> misc
A Little Trip to Paris <> Last week ended up being a complete whirlwind that I'm still getting over, but a very fun one indeed. On Monday morning before the sun had barely even risen Suzie, Lucy, Tijan and I were whisked away to Paris for the day with the French beauty subscription box service, My Little Box. We were invited along for a tour of the office and after a quick sit down for brunch and a fierce instagramming session we had a good nose around their beautiful space which, if I had to describe in just one word would be utterly 'Pinterestable'. From one food stop to the next we headed over to Buvette in the ninth arrondissement were I indulged in a plate of Croque-Forestier, a melt in the mouth cheese, bread and mushroom explosion that I won't be forgetting in a while. Afterwards we made a stop at Oh My Cream, a gorgeous beauty boutique dedicated entirely to skincare with the likes of Sunday Riley, Antipodes, REN and Aurelia lining the shelves. We had a workshop session on devising the perfect routine - aka an hour of trying out as many products as possible that I'd always wanted to get my hands on, and all left with a very big mental shopping list.  Our last hour in the city was spent doing a quick run of the pharmacies - no time to stop off as Sephora this time around unfortunately but I did manage to stock up on a year's worth of Bioderma! Before I knew it we were heading back to Le Gare du Nord and hopping on the train to London again. It was a fleeting visit but a very special one and I also vlogged the day - see below! Paris, you were beautiful as always and I miss you already! <>  misc
January Favourites <> Twelve months worth of favourites videos have been and gone and now we're back to square one with the first edition of 2015 and my January beauty loves. January wasn't the most exciting month for make up - I could probably count the number of times I went out of the house with a full face on two hands, but I still managed to pick out a some gems from the last few weeks, including an oh-so covetable brush that I've been dying to try and a new fragrance love! <> misc
The Best Healthy Cookies <> I'm a bit of a sweet tooth fiend when it comes to the weekends, especially when chocolate biscuits are involved - wave a packet of McVitties dark chocolate digestives anywhere near me and I'll be salivating. In order to avoid the inevitable mid-day sugar crash though I decided that making my own sweet treats would probably be best and began searching for the perfect healthy cookie recipe. For a long time it was an almost impossible task but just as I was about to give up hope and resign myself to the fact that flavour and 'good for you' ingredients just couldn't coincide I discovered Ella's blog. This place is literally a dairy, gluten and refined sugar free heaven and while I haven't quite taken the steps to eliminate all of those from my diet just yet, cutting down always makes an amazing difference to my energy levels. A year on and the Deliciously Ella cookbook has just hit the shelves and I made sure to grab myself a copy and devour it as quickly as possible. One of my favourite recipes from both the blog and book are the Chocolate Chia Cookies. These couldn't be easier to make (anything that can be thrown into a food processor all in one go gets a thumbs up from me) and they taste delicious, honestly better than any other biscuits I've tasted and bonus - they're packed full of good ingredients! A batch of these make for the perfect fuss free Sunday bake and will have your home smelling gloriously chocolaty without any of the guilt! <> misc
Disappointing Products <> It's not often that I focus on products I don't like or didn't get on with, as one person's least favourite mascara is bound to be someone's Holy Grail and I try to keep things as negativity free as possible when it comes to content. January always has me itching for a clear out though, particularly when it comes to my ever-growing make up stash, and whilst rummaging around in various drawers, baskets and containers I came across a handful of products that in one way or another really let me down, most of the time due to the hype that caused me to buy into them in the first place! For now they'll be making their way to new homes, but before that I thought I'd let you in on why these handful of products just didn't do it for me. <> misc
This Week: Lunch at Jamie's <> It's been a while since I had the chance to snap some mouthwateringly tasty food, as for the last month I've been keeping to my new year's resolutions pretty well (save a few squares of Dairy Milk here and there!) and have been avoiding eating out too frequently. My tastebuds ended up getting the better of me last weekend though and I practically skipped through the door of Jamie's Italian with one thing on my mind - the Baked Chestnut Mushrooms, probably my favourite restaurant dish ever. If you've yet to try it, do. The non-alcoholic refresher cocktail is an absolute must too - think liquid sour skittles over ice, perfection. I can't quite believe we've already reached the last This Week post of the month, and next Sunday we'll be in February. It'll honestly be 2016 before we know it! I've got a couple of exciting things coming up over the next few weeks, which include visits to my two favourite cities - London and Paris! After a few failed vlogging attempts since Vlogmas I'm determined to document it all properly, so expect to see some vlogs making a slightly more regular appearance on my channel over the next few months! <> misc
Drugstore Make Up Favourites <> The drugstore weekend take over continues with a look at my all time favourite budget make up products! I was aiming for a top ten, but after a good look through the archives and an hour or two playing with products at my dressing table it was impossible to narrow the selection down. I was so enthusiastic in fact, that I managed to ramble through this at almost hundred miles an hour (you may need to pause to get your breath back) and committed the ultimate beauty blogger sin of forgetting swatches - oops! Overlooking that though I let you all in on my love for L'Oreal eye products, make a case for a very convincing Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder dupe and pick out my top three bold lip options from the drugstore.. a very tough choice indeed! <> misc
New In: Three from the Drugstore <> Another day, another Boots haul! Checking the 'New In' section of beauty sites is a bit of a weekly ritual for me and when I spied an interesting looking green edition of my all time favourite mascara, I let out what was definitely a small squeal and mentally booked in a trip to the L'Oreal stand. The Miss Manga Punky Mascara boasts the same amazing formula but with a new plastic wand and some seriously fluorescent packaging. It actually physically pains me to say I was disappointed with this. The bristles are short and spiky as opposed to the long fibres of the original and left my lashes looking clumpy, uneven and actually wonky in places instead of the thick, full and separated look I've come to expect from Miss Manga. I've tried to love it, but really can't. Stick to the original ladies! I was also running low on another drugstore favourite - the Archery Pencil from Soap & Glory and (partly swayed by Suzie and this video) I decided to go for the lighter of the two colours, Blondshell. When swatched on my hand this is definitely too blonde for me and a lot warmer than my usual shade, but surprisingly fills in my brows really naturally. I find I can be much more heavy handed with this than the darker Hot Chocolate, which I've now been reserving for shaping the arch of my brows and filling in any super sparse areas.  Of course, it's always hard to escape a good deal in Boots and I ended up picking up a second product from Soap & Glory in the form of their Solar Powder. I really don't need another bronzer in my life, but I'm determined to find the perfect drugstore formula. On first use this actually reminded me the Clarins Bronzing Duo - a firm favourite in the bronzer rankings, and I have to say I'm impressed. This has none of the chalkiness I've come to expect of budget bronzers and is well pigmented with the perfect not too orange, not too muddy shade.  Two loves, one unexpected leave from the latest trip around the aisles. Have you tried any of these three? P.S - If you're into drugstore products, tomorrows video will be very much up your street! <> lifestyle
Minimal Make Up Routine <> I feel like I owe my skin a bit of a break after the festive season. Not only did I go all out on the full coverage foundations, party looks and glitter but I also consumed way too much dairy - aka the five Terry's Chocolate Oranges and entire family sized cheese board I polished off over Christmas and it's really taken it's toll. Since December I've barely worn make up at all unless I'm venturing out the house and even then it's just been a very simple routine of minimal but glow boosting products that have been giving my skin a well deserved breather. <> misc
Wear It, Beat It <> Who else is surprised that I've actually incorporated a little bit of colour into my wardrobe for a change? Seeing as about 90% of the clothes I own are either black, white or grey, I thought it was about time to branch out into something other than monochrome. I've been eyeing this beautiful red coat from Warehouse for a while now and after spying it in the Asos January sale I had to snap one up for myself. It's the cosiest thing ever, perfectly oversized to fit a snug jumper underneath and when teamed with a black and white outfit (let's face it, I can only handle so much colour at once) I can't get enough of it!

Wearing red may seem part of the norm for some but today I'm taking part in Wear It, Beat It, an event organised by the British Heart Foundation, a charity that's very close to my own heart. I think it's so important to give back and help others and for over 50 years the BHF have been at the forefront of research that's transformed the lives of those living with heart and circulatory diseases. The event takes place on Friday 6th February and you can join in by doing anything from wearing red - be it a piece of clothing or even a lipstick (I went for a slick of Maybelline Fab Orange myself), to hosting an event of your own whether it involves baking, having a red day at work or even just spending a night in with some red snacks and a film - I nominate Moulin Rouge! There's plenty of inspiration on the BHF site if you're struggling for ideas and you can also sign up for a free fundraising kit here. Don't forget to upload your red day image onto Instagram and Twitter on the 6th using the hashtag #WearItBeatIt. I can't wait to see all your selfies! <> style
This Week: Meet Up's & Halloumi Overload  <> It's been a while since I did a proper This Week post - let's blame my inability to remember to pull out the camera whenever I'm actually doing something, or the fact that eating food usually takes priority over snapping it. Yesterday though was Suzie's Meet Up in the Brighton Topshop Personal Shopping Space and I tagged along for the day to say hello and managed to meet a handful of the sweetest girls for a good chat over mini cupcakes. Of course, whenever we get together for the day food has to be involved and we stopped at the Italian Kitchen in Churchill Square for some quick lunch and went a little crazy with the Halloumi - burger for Suzie (which we were convinced contained a whole packet of the stuff) and salad for me as I'm still keen to stick to my goals this year of making sensible choices when it comes to food! Although it's very much in the early stages - aka just popped into our heads, Suzie and I would love to plan a meet up somewhere together in London to get a chance to meet even more of you, so let us know if that's something you'd come along to or like to see happen this year! <> misc
Three New Year's Lifestyle Resolutions <> Last January instead of making a list of resolutions as long as my arm that would no doubt be forgotten by the end of the month, I set myself three small and simple goals which, although may have wavered at some points - namely Christmas, Birthdays and any occasion that pizza was involved the night before, I feel like I've managed to keep up and even make a bit of a habit of overall. With that little success under my belt, this year I've decided to go one better and incorporate three slightly bigger changes into my daily life in hopes of aiming for a healthier and happier 2015. Getting on Top of Fitness Exercise and fitness is definitely something I neglected last year and could probably count the number of gym visits (and total amount of sit-ups managed) on one hand. This is something I definitely want to change in the coming months and seeing as there are so many amazing resources for fitness online these days, the majority of which cost absolutely nothing, I won't even have to leave the comfort of my living room to get started. Fitness Blender and Blogilates are now up there amongst my most watched channels on YouTube and with hundreds of easy to follow videos between them, my goal is to dedicate half an hour of my morning as often as possible to working through their archives. I've also taken the plunge this year and started the Kayla Itsines Bikini Body Work Out. If there was ever a motivational Instagram account to follow, it's Kayla's and after scrolling through people's stories of success and being overwhelmed by the positive attitude Kayla has towards living a healthier lifestyle I decided this was the work out for me. I was under no illusions that it was going to be an easy ride and although the morning after completing Day One it took me half an hour just to get out of bed, it was so invigorating to finish a whole work out knowing that I'm slowly but surely making my way to a positive change. Here's hoping I make it through the full twelve weeks! A Green Smoothie A Day.. Last year I rather unwisely got myself into drinking coffee and have become worryingly reliant on a caffeine boost to wake me up in the morning. Although the instant effects may feel good, I inevitably end up in a bit of a slump come midday and really hate to think what all that dark roast is doing to my insides. Although I'm sure I'll still be enjoying the odd cup every now and then - gotta' use up those Costa points, this year I want to switch my morning pick me up to something a little greener.  Investing in a Nutribullet was definitely one of the best decisions I've ever made and everything from smoothies to hummus is now a breeze to rustle up. The Green Monster from the Oh She Glows Cookbook is a super simple combination of almond milk, banana, spinach, chia seeds and almond butter (plus anything else you fancy throwing in) and one of my favourites smoothies to make. Not only do they taste delicious but I can literally feel the goodness spreading through me every time I drink a cup and substituting one a day for my regular coffee should have me bounding around the house with good, clean energy! Treating My Skin Let's be honest.. I'm not getting any younger and 2014 was definitely the year I began to notice just how much my skin has changed in it's 22nd year. It's shifted from the oily end of the scale to a now permanent state of dehydration and although drinking my two litres of water a day will always be the best remedy, treating myself to something other than my normal skincare routine at least once a week wouldn't go amiss.  I've started off the year with a round of the Elemis Cellular Recovery Skin Bliss Capsules*. These two-a-day little boosters are about as close to a detox as a skincare product could get, packed with anti-oxidants and reviving ingredients designed to help your skin get back to how it should be and couldn't come at a better time after an exhausting end to the year. I'm also big believer in masks but usually leave things until the last minute when my skin is crying out for a good purifying instead of taking preventative measures. This year I'm going to dedicate my Sunday evenings to having a make up free, masked up moment and I'll be relying on the Aesop Parsley Seed Masque to save me from my current skin woes.  Another good habit I'm aiming to get into is using a Ying Yu Jade Facial Roller*. The difference this makes on tired under-eyes in the morning is quite astonishing - and it feels wonderful. It's also a great one for boosting circulation to the face and making everything look brighter and heather. Let's get rolling, rolling, rolling..  My goals for the year may be a lot harder than last January's, but I'm determined to stick to them while keeping you updated in the process. Beauty will always be close to my heart, but this year I want to take I Covet Thee in a slightly different direction with a few lifestyle posts making their way in between the make up raves and new skincare finds and I'd love your feedback on this, along with your new year's resolutions too! What are you hoping to achieve in 2015? <> lifestle
Best of Beauty in 2014 <> Since we've reached the end of the year it only feels right to end things on a high note with the ultimate countdown of the best beauty products from the last twelve months. I'm talking make up, nails, skincare, hair products and everything body related wrapped up into two (undeniably long and rambling) videos that cover pretty much every category across the board. If you've been pondering what my favourite foundation, blusher, hair mask or even toner were throughout the year, grab yourself a cuppa', get comfortable and enjoy my roundup of the Best in Beauty from 2104! <> beauty
Summing Up Vlogmas <> Today we find ourselves facing the first Monday of 2015 and with that a sad realisation that the holidays are officially over and it's back to work and a normal routine that doesn't involve scoffing chocolate for breakfast every morning. For those still missing the festive feeling and with an hour on their hands for a bit of YouTube catch up, I've rounded up this year's Vlogmas four-parter below which, fingers crossed, should be enough to ease your Christmas cravings.  Part One - [here] Things got off to a little bit of a slow start - vlogging on a Monday is never the most thrilling experience, but midweek Darren's band Fantana played an awesome gig which I managed to get a snippet of - followed by a cheeky late night McDonald's drive through, oops! Other highlights include a rummage around in my grocery shopping, opening advent calendars and a behind the scenes look at my Winter Coat Lookbook. We started shopping for Christmas decorations, put up the tree and I got my first festive coffee fix of the month.  Part Two - [here] This week was an incredibly busy one and unfortunately I didn't manage to pick up the camera as much as I would have liked, but an intense week of Birthdays, work and a whirlwind trip to London were rounded off with a lovely weekend away in Brighton. Darren and I met up with Suzie and Josh and we attempted to eat the biggest burger and chips I've ever had placed in front of me, took a lovely stroll around a very festive looking city - expect many shots of twinkly lights, and stayed in a pretty funky hotel complete with pink floors and a see-through toilet door. Part Three - [here] The third instalment of Vlogmas was my favourite by far. Suzie came to visit, this time with Nala in tow (who I'm convinced is the sweetest dog in the world) and we spend a hilarious afternoon filming some festive-themed videos (check them out here) which was rounded off perfectly with a Nando's and a good chat. On the weekend I finally made it to my favourite Christmas market of the year in Winchester and spent the day wandering around the stalls, doing some last minute shopping and getting into the festive spirit. Part Four - [here] A short and sweet final vlog summing up my Christmas Day, spent visiting family, eating ALL the food (Christmas dinner is possibly my favourite meal of the year) and vegging out on the sofa in festive pyjamas after a lovely but tiring day. <> misc
The Post-NYE Saviour <> Happy New Year everyone and welcome to the first post of 2015 - woo! I hope you all had a fabulous night and whether it was spent in heels or pyjamas, I have no doubt we all stayed up a lot later than usual and are probably paying for it this morning. As a year-round member of the dark circle club - no matter how much sleep I get or how many litres of water I drink they're always just there, I've done my fair share of research on the subject of hiding them and one product that I've found to do a pretty fantastic job is the Estée Lauder Double Wear Brush-On Glow BB Highlighter.  A few dots (or half the tube in my case) of this over the top of your regular concealer brightens everything up incredibly well, especially when taken in a Kim-K style 'V' from the inner corner of your eye to the cheekbone. Some may even be able to get away with using this alone - for a highlighting pen the coverage isn't too shabby, but for me doubling up on formulas is a must. This probably won't be the end of my lifelong search for the perfect all in one concealer - a girl can dream, right? But for now, I know I'll be twisting up a generous amount of this come New Year's day and after all late nights to follow. Heck - it's even packed in a beautiful gold tube that will ride in like a Knight in shining armour to ease your eye-bag woes! <> misc
December Favourites <> December often gets left out when it comes to my monthly favourites videos as it's usually scrapped in favour of the big yearly round up - of which my 2014 edition will be making it's way to you this week, but seeing as it's probably my favourite month of all (excluding June of course, who doesn't love their birthday month the most!?) I've gathered together a small selection of my most reached for products from the last four weeks, including a few festive picks, an old favourite revisited and a Winter skincare duo that I can't rave about enough! <> misc
The Best of I Covet Thee in 2014 <> he facts and figures nerd inside me loves to keep an eye on statistics, so as we approach the end of a year's worth of blogging (mostly involving staring blankly at a computer screen wondering why the camera decided to focus on the wall instead of my face), it's always interesting to see what your favourite moments were. Below are the five most popular posts of 2014! Do you remember them all? Make Up Collection & Storage: Muji Drawer Tour - I'm not surprised this twenty-minute ramble about my make up collection comes in at the top spot as I've been known to dedicate far too much time myself to watching make up storage videos online - let's call it a guilty pleasure. Collections grow and change at a considerable speed and this one's already starting to look a little old, could it be time for an update? Get Ready With Me: Everyday Autumn Make Up - Probably my favourite look of the year, this simple everyday make up with a smokey eye and a bold lip twist was also the most viewed video of the last twelve months.  Minimal Make Up - Despite my love of 'piling it all on' when it comes to make up, I'm always on the hunt for the perfect combination of products to achieve that coveted 'no make up make up' look. I may not have cracked the ultimate five product face quite yet, but this post came very close.  What's In My Bag: Zara Mini Office City - Another YouTube tag staple and one that I always have a good time filming. Cue rummaging around in the depths of my handbag and revealing the ridiculous amount of lip products I carry around on a daily basis. I think we got up to seven in this one. By Terry Ombre Blackstar: A Highstreet Dupe - Who doesn't love a good budget dupe? Especially when it's a purse-friendly version of one of the year's most raved about make up staples. Here's to more budget finds in 2015! <> style
Beauty Sales Picks <> In recent years Boxing Day has been all about consuming my body weight in cheese and leftovers, spending the entire day in festive themed pyjamas and most importantly, tucking myself up on the sofa, iPad in hand and dedicating a good few hours to trawling the online beauty sales. There are always some gems to be found - particularly when it comes to reduced Christmas sets and brand-wide discounts and all without the stress of venturing into an actual shop on the day all sales assistants have come to loath - trust me, I've been there.  Space NK is always one for slashing prices on covetable brands and this year their Best of Cracker Set includes deluxe travel sizes from Oribe, Laura Mericer and Caudalie to name a few. I can see myself busting these open upon arrival rather then waiting patiently until everyone is sat around the table. The Tarte Au Citron Luxe Quartet from Laura Mericer also makes an appearance in the sale containing a body cream, honey bath, scrub and shimmer mist all in this zesty but sweet scent. Similarly Cult Beauty have turned out a few corkers from their roster of amazing brands, including the Kevyn Aucoin Essentials Eyeshadow Set which comes in three shades - number one being my favourite, each housing six beautifully wearable neutrals with velvety smooth textures.  The majority of this year's picks all hail from Look Fantastic which certainly didn't disappoint in the sales department, starting with an amazing almost half-price discount on the Sunday Riley Effortless Breathable Tinted Primer, a sheer but unifying base I've been eyeing since it's first Lisa Eldridge mention many moons ago. They're also serving up a helping of Limited Edition NARS in the form of the Algorithm Bronzing Powder - a.k.a Laguna packed up in some pretty decadent packaging. As we all know NARS products are the worst absorbers of dust, make up and smudges, so this palette is very tempting, and it's just so, so pretty. Nail polishes are always a guaranteed sales find, and the Nails Inc Alexa Hearts Collection (which I actually happened to receive myself this Christmas - yes it's just as stunning in real life) teams three gorgeous unique shades with three not-to-be-missed top coats; chunky gold stars, red hearts and a holographic glitter. I also can't help but be tempted by the chic and elegant glass bottles of the Deborah Lippmann nail polishes - a brand I've never tried but judging from the amount of neutral shades and this amazing looking glitter, one I'm sure I'll be owning soon. In the slightly more indulgent price range comes the GHD Rose Gold Straightner Set. Rose Gold. GHD's. Fifteen percent off. Need I say more? For skincare lovers and fans of investing in products the Sarah Chapman range has been widely discounted on Feel Unique and as a lover of their cult Overnight Facial, I can't help but be intrigued by the Morning version which claims to plump and boost radiance as well as it's evening predecessor with a lighter, more day friendly formula. As in most post-Christmas sales, the Clarasonic Mia is reduced again and I really couldn't think of a better way to treat your skin in the Winter months. It may have it's pro's and con's, but I know it can be relied on to pull my skin out of any sort of drama and with consistent use (something I admittedly slack on) really does make a vast difference. Ending on a accessories note, Asos is the place to go right now if you're looking for a new make up bag. My favourite of the bunch is this Cath Kidston Double Decker Bus Print which I can see happily housing all my daily picks. If you're more into beauty tools, Beauty Bay have a sweet little set of Tweezerman mini tweezers - the undisputed best of the best, alongside an eyelash curler which I've heard very, very good things about. Bonus points also for the beautiful silver and white design - always a sucker for chic packaging! <> beauty
The Pre-Christmas Pamper | #ICovetChristmas <> I'm sure we're probably all in the same boat right now and that boat is named 'stressed out to the max'. Gone are the days when deciding which Christmas film to watch next was the most strenuous task in December, and now it's countless shopping trips, planning meals, hand-aching card writing sessions and the never ending task of wrapping presents (which is still on my to-do list for tonight, yikes!). I think it's fair to say that we could all do with a little pamper time, and what better night to save it for than Christmas Eve.  For me, a bath means instant relaxation, and I've been holding onto a little bar of The Comforter from Lush with the intention of using it tonight, hence it's slightly lacklustre appearance.. Sweet, fruity and warm, but uplifting at the same time it's the perfect one to leave you refreshed and calm and also teams up nicely with Rose Jam Shower Gel, one of this year's limited Christmas editions.  Masks all around is usually the way I like to go for a serious pamper session, so it's REN's Glycolatcic Radiance Renewal Mask for the face (again another sample size I've been hoarding for just such an occasion) which exfoliates with a combination of gentle acids to blast away dull looking skin and Bumble & Bumble's Deep Treatment to re-hydrate my over-styled, dry Winter hair. All the bonus points to this one for smelling like sugary bananas and leaving my locks super smooth after every use. Finishing touches include a good helping of Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate*, an overnight miracle worker that's only recently been added to my routine but one I can sense is never going to be leaving. A few drops before moisturiser is all you need to wake up on the big day with bright, glowing skin. There's also nothing like winding down in some festive pyjamas with your favourite Christmas flick - The Holiday will always be the one for me, an entire Terry's Chocolate Orange for one (because calories don't count around this time of year, of course) and getting yourself Christmas Day ready with a manicure. Essie's Winter Collection Miniatures are doing it for me at the moment, and I think the sparkle silver 'Jiggle Hi Jiggle Low' is going to be the one tonight! Will you be indulging in a Christmas Eve pamper? <> misc
Christmas Q&A With Suzie! | #ICovetChristmas <> The lovely Suzie and I got together in front of the camera again last week and instead of the usual beauty chit chat, we thought we'd embrace that festive feeling and answer your Christmas questions! Expect some (possibly not so wonderful) singing, drooling over Xmas dinner foods and the great Christmas film debate: The Holiday or Love Actually? Enjoy! <> misc
The Christmas Jumper | #ICovetChristmas <> It's no secret that I love a good Christmas jumper (just check the stash I have tucked away under my bed from the last five years) and when it comes to picking the right festive attire, it's usually the tackier the better. This December though I've gone down a completely different route with an understated grey number from H&M. Being a fan of the monochrome wardrobe - black, grey and white make up the majority of my outfits these days, this slots in perfectly and the simple 'Dear Santa, I Want It All' slogan written in cute silver balls which A) couldn't be more relevant and B) adds just the right festive touch.  It's also a jumper I'm not ashamed to be seen wearing in public - unlike the bright red light up snowman equipped with 3D nose and scarf I have somewhere in my collection, and have happily wandered around in it all week with Mariah Carey playing on repeat in my head. Have you found this year's Christmas jumper yet? <> misc
Christmas Party Make Up | #ICovetChristmas <> When I think about the festive party season one word stands out to me; glitter, glitter and more glitter. It just isn't Christmas without it, so for this year's party look I've gone for a beyond sparkly gold eye and of course, lashings of red lipstick. This also marks the start of my countdown to the big day - look out for the hashtag #ICovetChristmas, where things are going to get sickeningly festive around these parts.. you have been warned! <> misc
Serozinc Comes to the UK <> The moment all skincare lovers have been waiting for is finally here, La Roche-Posay's Serozinc Zinc Sulfate Solution is now available to buy in the UK! This little blue can just about clinches the title for 'most hyped skincare products of the year' (who thought a toner could make me giddy with joy when spotted in the aisles of a Parisian pharmacy?) but unless you were planning a trip to France or willing to drop more than double the asking price on eBay, it's proved practically impossible to obtain. Thankfully though the skincare Gods have heard our calling and Serozinc will be stocked for the first time on Escentual. Still not quite as easy as popping down your local Boots, but fingers crossed with the likes of Bioderma now being rolled out across the country, we may not have to wait too long before picking up a can of this skin soothing, blemish fighting wonder becomes as easy as buying toothpaste! <> misc
Three Winter Coats <> The Winter coat is probably my favourite item of clothing ever, but since finding 'The One' isn't always easy I've picked three different styles that cover all bases - the smart option, the throw on jacket and something warm and cosy. Put those all together with some chilly-weather appropriate outfits, a few awkward in-car changes and a very cold Saturday afternoon and you have three minutes of Winter wardrobe goodness! <> misc
Winter Skincare Staples <> It doesn't take much to get me chatting about skincare, especially in Winter when a combination of bad weather, central heating and scoffing as much Christmas chocolate as I can get my hands on turns my skin into a dehydrated, dull mess. When the colder months roll around I like to bulk up my routine with a few extra steps and re-introduce the products that I know will keep things as soft and hydrated as they should be - my Winter staples! <> misc
November Favourites <> The second to last edition of this year's favourites videos - my how time flies when you're hoarding lipsticks. I've found an unexpected nail polish love, a body butter that will make you want to eat your own arm it smells so good and a handful of new make up items that I haven't been able to say no to all month! <> misc
What's On My Christmas List <>  Things are about to get very festive around these parts come December, so what better way to kick things off than with my own personal Christmas List. Over the past few months I've been putting in some serious time window shopping, saving up links and scribbling things down on post-it notes that I've ensured make their way into Darren's possession, mostly by sticking them on the bathroom mirror.  Unsurprisingly the list is a beauty exclusive zone, starting with a perfume that's been on my mind for nearly an entire year when I came across it last December. Diptyque Volutes Eau de Toilette is a deep, musky fragrance unlike anything else in my collection and one that would make for a perfect warm Winter scent. I've also been eyeing up their Baies Room Spray after my trip to Suzie's where this made her entire flat smell beautiful. Candles have always been a constant in my Christmas lists over the years and this time it's the Malin + Goetz Votive Set that's caught my eye. While the scents of Dark Rum, Tocacco and Vetiver may be an odd combination to get your head around, I've heard they're not to be missed. The colder seasons are also when I like to indulge in a good amount of bath time and Laura Mercier's Honey Musk Bath & Body Duet, combining the Soufflé Body Cream and Honey Bath, looks like the perfect touch of luxury for this. Also on the list for winding down in the evening is the This Works Deep Sleep Plus+, a soothing pillow spray that aids in drifting off to sleep and another constant on my list year by year. The new ramped up Plus+ formula also promises to help any restless sleepers enjoy an uninterrupted slumber and I can't say no to that. Aside from the obligatory novelty socks (these Christmas Kitten pair from Asos are definitely the one) the last few bits on this list fall somewhere in the category of 'it's just so pretty!' items that I can't get out of my head, including the Zoeva Rose Gold Brush Set which I've been dreaming of owning for months - not just a beautiful set of brushes but from a brand I've come to trust and love too, and the Nails Inc Alexa Hearts Collection. Since Alexa Chung became the face of the brand and the new packaging design launched earlier this year, Nails Inc have been peaking my interest more so than my all time favourite Essie - and that's saying something. This set contains six polishes, with three exclusive shades, a holographic top coat and two chunky glitters made up of hearts and stars. I'm in love! Deep breath - that was a long one! What's on your Christmas list this year? <> style
Weekend Vlog: Christmas Markets & Crepes <> Like it or not, Vlogmas is right around the corner and in preparation for a whole month of non-stop vlogging I thought it was about time to dust off the camera and get back into the swing of things with a few snippets from last weekend. It may not have been the most eventful two days but things are getting pretty festive around these parts so a visit to the first Christmas market of the year was in order. Large amounts of crepe were consumed, fairy lights awed at and Primark raided for novelty knitwear. All in all, a good weekend I'd say! <> misc
Jennifer Lawrence Inspired Drugstore Make Up Look <> It was only a matter of time before I had to sit down and recreate one of Jennifer Lawrence's make up looks. From her always glowing skin to the fact that she's absolutely hilarious, I'm bordering on obsessed with this girl. Jen (yes, we're on first name terms now) wore this natural dewy make up with a subtle smoky eye to the LA Premiere of The Hunger Games Mockingjay movie and I'm sure it's one I'll be bringing out again and again! <> beauty
Autumn Beauty Haul <> The last month has been a good one for beauty buys - from a trip to the Burberry store in Covent Garden to browsing the aisles of boots (can't beat a 3 for 2!) and today I'm showing you what's made it into my shopping basket. I've gone a little mad on the lip pencil front, found a concealer that might just replace my beloved Origins Plantscription and stocked up on bath goodies for some cosy Autumn soaks!  <> beauty
