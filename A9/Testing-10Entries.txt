How I Style My Hair: Easy Laid Back Waves <> Today we're talking hair! Specifically how I've been styling mine. Questions have been rolling in over social media recently wanting to know how I've been achieving my go to style - easy laid back waves, so today I'm going to give you a step by step guide to literally the simplest hair look ever! I've also teamed up with TRESemmé for this post as, drumroll please.. I'll be flying out to New York with them on Friday for Fashion Week! Without doubt TRESemmé are a hair staple these days, and I've used three of their best styling products in todays look. Perfect hair isn't always easy, and this season TRESemmé want to inspire and empower you to #WorkIt with their huge range of products to get the look you love, whether that's laid back and lived in, or glammed up super chic! I'll also be going backstage with them for a handful of shows, so expect to see a lot of NYFW content coming your way soon! STEP ONE: BOOST This style honestly couldn't be easier to fit into your routine, as it literally takes me ten minutes to wiz through every morning. Prep is key to a quick style though, so I usually start things off the night before when I wash my hair. Volume is the number one for me when it comes to my hair aspirations, and mousse is one of the best products to use for this. Starting with damp hair I comb through about a golf ball sized amount of the TRESemmé Volume & Lift Mousse with my fingers, concentrating it at the roots. A quick blast of the hair dryer leaves my hair with long-lasting fullness without the sticky texture of a dry spray, as well as all the weightless volume I could ever need!  Don't forget to run whats left in your hands into the rest of your hair too, as this is going to hold in the waves when we come to using heat. STEP TWO: PROTECT Before you step anywhere near the curling wand though, protecting your hair is key. The TRESemmé Heat Defense Styling Spray has been around ever since I picked up my first pair of GHD's a long, long time ago. It keeps hair safe up to 230 degrees and increases softness and shine too. I honestly think I've stuck with this spray for so long because the nozzle is just the best (weirdo alert, I know). A lot of spray products can end up leaving a whole lot of product in one little spot on your head - not great when I'm trying my best to protect every single overprocessed, overworked strand! Whereas the spritz on this is such a fine mist it covers lightly and evenly all over. STEP THREE: TEXTURE Next, onto the main part of this routine - adding the waves. My tool of choice is a medium tapered curling wand, but you can also get a similar effect with straighteners if you have those to hand. The most important part of achieving lose falling curls is actually how you hold the wand. With much trial and error I've found pointing it down and at a forty-five degree angle (or thereabouts) gives the best curl formation. Also the way in which you wrap the hair makes a huge difference too. If you twist as you go, things are going to end up on the 80's side of kinky, so make sure you keep the hair flat and straight against the wand. Try not to overthink it though - with practice you'll have the technique down in your sleep. EXTRA TIP! While the hair is cooling, pull apart the curls with your fingers. This breaks up the texture into waves and gives a much more seperated effect than brushing out with a comb, and doesn't leave them as broken down as running your hands all the way through. STEP FOUR: HOLD Depending on your hair texture this style might last all day, but for my naturally straight and flat hair I like the guaranteed hold of a setting product. The Extra Hold Hairspray from TRESEmmé is seriously heavy duty in keeping loose waves in place, but without any of the stiffness you'd usually think came hand in hand with a maximum hold spray.  My hair still feels soft enough to run my fingers through after this step and I also like to spray some through the roots for a last boost of volume, as well as keeping flyaways at bay. It's humidity resistant as well - perfect for the frizz prone, humid streets of NYC! <> beauty

What's on My Christmas List This Year <> Kicking off the festivities around these parts, I've compiled a little Christmas Wishlist of mine to share with you today! I'm not massively into gift guides (although I have one up on my channel if you're looking for a special beauty gift to give this year!) but I thought taking a peek at my own personal list would be fun! Sidenote/disclaimer, wishful thinking is playing a very big part here..ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS.. MISSOMA MINI FANG NECKLACE - This super dainty little piece has been playing on my mind for months now! I've been way more into silver metals recently but the combination of the warm gold and the sweet little 'fang' charms on this necklace is gorgeous. It also comes in a longer version too! BELLA FREUD SIGNATURE CANDLE - Would it be an ICT Wishlist if it didn't involve a candle? All of the Bella Freud candles sound totally unique and the packaging is 10/10. This one is Incense Wood & Oud - warm, spicy and everything I love at this time of year! OLIVER BONAS PRINT - When we moved into a place with more space over a year ago now, I envisioned walls covered in prints, but its something I've yet to put much thought into. Oliver Bonas - always my go-to for gift giving, have the best little selection of pre-framed prints (already making life so much easier) and this Andy Warhol quote speaks to me on many levels. OLIVER BONAS TABLE LAMP - Who doesn't love a lamp? Particularly when it comes in polka dot form. I love these concrete base lights and I've been looking for the right one to sit on my dressing table for some time now.. SAINT LAURENT PINK BLOGGER BAG - This is where things fall slightly into the absurd. I love my little black version of this bag and think the pink one would be adorable for Spring and Summer! OLIVER BONAS COCKTAIL SET - My Christmas present to myself this year (ahem, thats totally a thing, right?) is this incredible gold and marble bar table that I've been pining over forever. I'm not a huge drinker, but what's better than mixing up a cosy cocktail on a Winter's evening and this Jigger & Spoon set from Oliver Bonas would be the perfect addition! Also not quite over the fact that 'Jigger' is actually the word for that measuring cup.. I'll show myself out. CHANEL LE CRAYON LÈVRES IN 34 NATURAL - Believe it or not this little lip pencil has been a tricky one to find. I think I've got lipsticks pretty much down for now. Please, no more! But it's lip liners that I really don't have enough of. This pinkish browny nude would be the perfect shade to wear alone or with just about any lip colour. BELLA FREUD EMBROIDERED JUMPER - Wishful thinking strikes again with this Bella Freud jumper. I know I'd wear this to death though as it checks all the boxes for me; grey, embroidered, a little bit out there.. perfect! MISSOMA MOON STUD - Another cheeky Missoma edition - I love this brand! Of course anything to do with Moons gets my instant attention these days. I'm really into mixing & matching my earrings at the moment and love that you can buy these individually to do so. There's so many beautiful studs and styles but this one has to be my favourite! A FEW LITTLE EXTRAS  As if that wasn't enough, I also have a few other bits on my Wishlist that I've listed below. I'm constantly adding to this list whenever I find something that would make a perfect gift, for myself or others. So keep checking back if you're after some Christmas  inspiration! <> style
My Five Favourite Products Of The Year <> Narrowing down my favourite beauty finds from what - lets be honest, is a hoarders paradise of different products may seem like daunting task, but it actually became incredibly simple when I started to think about the products I couldn't go a day without. Cult beauty, a site which I find myself browsing more frequently than ASOS these days (and that's saying something), invited me to share five of my favourite cult products to find my ultimate must have of the year, and I've got the cream of the beauty crop here for you today! Oskia RENAISSANCE CLEANING GEL First impressions of the Oskia Renaissance Cleansing Gel always seem to be somewhere along the lines of 'what's so special about it?' and while I could probably give you a list about as long as my arm detailing why its just that good, the reason I know it's is always going to be the cleanser for me is that I never fail to come back to it. No matter how many different skincare products I try there isn't one that I've repurchased as many times as this despite how long it actually takes me to use up a bottle, even with daily use. One pump per cleanse is seriously enough! Whenever my skin isn't looking it's best, if I feel like things are getting a little dull, or I just need a quick boost of moisture I reach for this rose scented cleanser. It's so light and gentle but really goes a long way towards brightening up and refreshing the surface of your skin. The gel is hydrating but not thick, although it's rich enough to massage in like there's no tomorrow when you're cleansing and it's make up removing abilities are unparalleled and takes off mascara like no other.  Natural skin care lovers will be please to know this is an all natural product that uses pumpkin enzymes and Vitamin A to resurface dead cells from the skins surface in a thorough but gentle way making it perfect for sensitive skin too, leaving all skin types soft, hydrating and ready for the next step of your routine.Sunday Riley LUNA SLEEPING NIGHT OIL Another skincare hero that has been a staple in my routine is the Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Night Oil. Sunday Riley never fail to impress me with their products - I love absolutely everything they put their name to. This bright blue, retinol based oil may just be the best of the bunch though and one of those rare skincare finds that I get almost instant results with after just one night's use. Dehydration, dullness, breakouts and redness are just a handful of the problems Luna seems to fix for me, making it the ultimate pick me up. With consistent use too I've noticed just how much clearer, brighter and plumped my skin has become over time just by adding a few drops into my evening routine. Becca x Jaclyn Hill SHIMMERING SKIN PERFECTOR IN CHAMPAGNE POP I don't often fall in love with Limited Edition launches for fear of never being able to get my hands on them again, but when Becca teamed up with Jaclyn Hill to create the Pressed Shimmering Skin Perfector in Champagne Pop I knew it was going to be good. So good in fact, that it's now part of the permanent collection - everyone breathe a sigh of relief! Everything I loved about the super smooth, highly pigmented formula of the Shimmering Skin Perfector range, combined with the richest shade of warm, champagne peach made for an instant favourite in the highlighting department with all other contenders forgotten for good. Huda Beauty LIQUID MATTE I think it's safe to say 2016 has well and truly been the year of liquid lipsticks and there's no doubt that I am firmly on that bandwagon. Long lasting, matte colour that's easy to apply and never smudges - a.k.a a bold lip lovers idea of heaven, my liquid lip collection nearly outweighs my now 'old fashioned' stash OG lipsticks. The Huda Beauty Matte Lips in Bombshell is my favourite for an everyday neutral. Who'd have thought I'd be here professing my love for a nude lip over a red one - but it's happening. I'm officially a convert and I think this shade has had something to do with it. It's one of those highly coveted 'your lips but better' colours with just the right hint of pink to be incredibly flattering to fairer skin tones and now remains a constant in the bottom of my handbag thanks to its awesome staying powder. Ouai HAIR OIL One of the most exciting beauty moments this year for me came in the form of Ouai hair care. From the sleek minimal packaging to the simple range of products I was all over this launch when it hit the site. Everything I've tried just works so well but my favourite discovery to date has been the Hair Oil.  My hair hasn't been in the best shape recently. The blonder I've gotten the more moisture it's been craving and an oil has been an absolute must when it comes to styling. Most days I just run a pump of this through the ends and go. It smells dreamy, is light enough not to weigh down fine hair texture and keeps any brittle ends super soft and manageable. Five amazing products that I couldn't be without. I really do reach for these every single day and choosing just one for my Cult Product of the Year seems like an impossible task, but when it comes down to it, the Oskia Renaissance Cleansing Gel has to be one of the greatest and most loved beauty products ever. We all know I love a good bit of skincare! <> beauty
Silk For Your Skin <> Clinique's Superbalanced range and I go way, way back. It was my first high end foundation purchase - one that I mulled over for weeks, checking back to my local counter for samples until I finally decided to take the plunge. Since then foundations have come and gone, but I've always come back to my first choice. One that I know I can count when I need my skin to look great. SKIN LIKE SILK Flash back to the present and Clinique have updated the original formula with the new Superbalanced Silk Makeup - all my favourite parts of the original with some new and innovative extras thrown in. As the name suggests its still an incredibly intelligent balancing foundation, hydrating dry areas and keeping oily patches at bay at the same time, making it an all rounder for skin types and perfect for tricky combination skin! The texture really does resemble silk too - it even has real silk built into the formula! It glides onto skin effortlessly with minimal buffing and blending needed   achieve a flawless look, and the finish resembles something very close to naturally matte skin, as well as injecting a tonne of glowing radiance that lasts all day long without having to worry about about product slipping around or becoming overly shiny. The coverage on offer is impressive for such a light weight feeling foundation, enough for me to skip the majority of concealing around the face as it evens out tone and hides red patches - my biggest skin concern, well enough to use alone. At the same time though I also like to use a minimal amount and sheer it out for a super natural look that let's a little of my natural skin shine through. Choosing the right amount of cover for you is made easy with Clinique's Buff Brush that combines short dense bristles and long sparse ones, making it super easy to build up coverage or sheer out formulas with one beautiful tool. Flawless, long lasting and silky smooth - it checks all the boxes I have when looking for a new foundation as well as containing SPF 15 for some added protection when wearing through the day!  <> beauty
The Three Best Apps For Instagram <> Instagram has always been my favourite form of social media within the few I find myself checking every day. I love photography and beautiful images so it's no doubt I end up refreshing my feed endlessly. Of course when it comes to my own profile I'm incredibly picky about the photos I upload - as I am with so many other things in life! It's taken me a long time to get the process down but I now have a set of steps that I follow each time I edit a photo that ensures they all fit together and satisfy my perfection driven little brain! Of course, my photos would be nothing without the apps they're edited on and there are three in particular that I couldn't be without.. VSCOCAM Starting with the obvious, VSCOCam is my go-to when first approaching an edit. Although there are an array of editing tools on offer from Exposure and Contrast to Saturation and Sharpening, I actually find these far too bulky and not precise enough to really fine tune a photo. Instead I skip straight to the filters and leave the colour correction for later. A lot of apps offer different filters, but I find VSCOcam has the most aesthetically pleasing options available, whether you're after something bright and vibrant, dark and moody or a more akin to real film, they all make such a difference but are subtle enough not to detract from there photo itself. It's definitely worth paying a little extra to get the full set of filters, as there are so many more variations on offer than the original set you're given with the app. My favourites come from the H, S and F families but I really only stick to using one or two for more cohesion within my feed. My biggest gripe with the application of the filters is that you can only add one per image, but I like to get around this by saving the photo and re-uploading it again to run through the process a second time - although I wouldn't recommend doing this more than twice as you're photo is likely to lose quality the more times it's saved. FACE TUNE Believe it or not, I use Facetune for just about everything other than tuning my face. It's the app I spend the most time with and the one that I find really makes a difference in the final outcome of my pictures. There are just so many incredibly useful things that it has to offer and the one app that I would liken most to using an actual photoshop programme thanks to it's 'finger scrubbing' action that allows you to select precisely which parts of the photo you want to edit, change or apply filters to. The most used and most talked about is definitely the 'Whiten' tool. This is great for taking out stubborn yellow tones on white backgrounds, removing small shadows and reducing saturation from overly bright objects. The 'Smooth' tool works incredibly well at removing grainy areas from images taken in low light and 'Details' helps to sharpen text on product shots that might otherwise be too blurry or washed out to read while 'Patch' is the best for taking away stray marks on clothes, imperfections in a background or even removing the odd toe that might have sneaked in while photographing a flat lay. My favourite and most used part of Face Tune though are the 'Filters'. I think this actually gets completely overlooked by most as the layout may lead you to believe it's just another set of coloured overlays à la VSCOcam, but actually it's the 'Lighting' part that I find absolutely invaluable. We all know I like a nice bright Instagram photo, and this tool allows you to scrub over any dark areas or shadows or brighten the entire photo on a level from 1-100, as well as giving you the option to darken certain areas that have become too over exposed. MOSAICO  Finally, this is the one where I put it all together. Although there may be an eye roll or two when it comes to the subject of planning your Instagram feed I think it's so important in creating balance to at least have an idea what to put where. The perfectionist inside me has deleted so many photos almost as soon as they were uploaded as it's only when everything comes together that it's easier to notice what doesn't quite fit. Mosaico is the app that all of you pedantic planners have been missing in your life. It allows you to import photos into a grid identical to Instagram and the best bit of all - you can actually drag and drop images into place, letting you to fiddle around with positioning for hours on end without having to constantly import and delete pictures.  There's also the option to go into a 'ghost mode' where you can temporarily preview the removal of an existing photo in your feed if things just aren't looking right or you're considering taking out a post that isn't working!  I just love the entire layout of the app. It's well designed, works smoothly and although there's not much else too it, the idea it's based on is so simple that it's become such a useful tool for me in planning when to post. Although some may like to take photos on a camera before importing into your app of choice, I like to stick to phone quality images as after all, that's what Instagram was originally all about. That doesn't have to mean skimping out on picture quality though. I've been using the iPhone SE for all my snaps on the go recently and love the way they look. Plus, it comes in rose gold and is just about the most beautiful thing ever! If you're a big traveller and love to Instagram wherever you go I'd also highly recommend looking into your data plan. Wifi spots, although common, never seem to be exactly where you want them, but with Three's Feel At Home service you can actually use your regular internet allowance to upload whatever you fancy without having to worry about a huge bill at the end of the month! <> misc
Gucci Bamboo <> Scent is a very special thing. It can comfort, uplift, evoke long lost memories and most importantly empower you. Stepping out the door without a fragrance is like forgetting the finishing accessories with an outfit, or a skipping a final slick of lipstick. There's just something missing without it. Scent is a very special thing. It can comfort, uplift, evoke long lost memories and most importantly empower you. Stepping out the door without a fragrance is like forgetting the finishing accessories with an outfit, or a skipping a final slick of lipstick. There's just something missing without it. Finding the right fragrance is the tricky thing, of course. Hundreds of sweet, sour, fruity or floral notes in a thousand different combinations. How do you know when you've discovered the one? For me it's an instant feeling. A sudden rush when a scent makes contact with skin to create an incredibly personal aroma that fills your entire head with joy. The scents I love range from deep and musky to soft and sweet, but a really pure, clean fragrance is one that I've always searched for. Gucci Bamboo is a combinations of notes that I've come to know well in various other perfumes, but never together. Sparkling Citruses in the top notes remind me of holidays in the Mediterranean, fragrant petals of Lily and Ylang Ylang in the heart radiate a floral bouquet and warm Sandalwood and Tahitian Vanilla finish up the base with an inviting twist. Wrapped up into one these form a crisp, clean scent with the softest of musky undertones. The notes create a ripple of different textures as the fragrance adapts from feminine and light upon first application, to something a little more sensual as it moves through to the night. Perfect to wear when you want to shifts moods in the evening while still hinting at your favourite day time scent. The Eau de Toilette is the lighter sister of the original Eau De Parfum. It's more intense and vibrant attitude plays on the stronger side of scent and has the potential to evoke even more confidence in the wearer. For me the EDT is my perfect scent. It's a fun and playful fragrance with the power to draw out a confident side that you may not have otherwise known was lurking underneath. It's a trait that we all have deep down inside us - some more than others, but one that we should all aspire to use to it's fullest, and with the help of the right perfume, that's one step closer. <> beauty
Summer Denim <> In my wardrobe a good outfit revolves around a good pair of jeans. Denim is a staple for me whether its black skinny jeans in Winter (who am I kidding, black skinny jeans all year round), a bleached boyfriend fit for Spring or ripped cut offs in Summer.. I love it all. DENIM LOVER In my wardrobe a good outfit revolves around a good pair of jeans. Denim is a staple for me whether its black skinny jeans in Winter (who am I kidding, black skinny jeans all year round), a bleached boyfriend fit for Spring or ripped cut offs in Summer.. I love it all.  One of my first ports of call for denim is always Topshop. They do just about every cut, colour and style a girl could ask for. My current favourite fit are the Mom jeans, I've been obsessed with this high waisted, slightly slouchy but structured style and these light wash distressed pair are the perfect Summer piece for me!  Mom jeans are probably the easiest thing to take from super casual to put together in an instant just by adding a pair of heels. Together with this cropped, striped, off the shoulder bardot top - another style I'm way too into at the moment, and a little black bag this is actually one of my favourite outfits for cool July days.  I've put together a wishlist below of some of my favourite jeans Topshop have to offer this season and there's a whole lot of embroidery, white denim and ripped up knees going on. Never did I think that a pair of floral embroidered jeans would be calling my name past the age of twelve, but this questionable trend from my youth is coming back around whether you like it or not, and I have to say, I really do! <> style
Starting Your Day With The Right Skincare <> I'm going to be blunt - mornings are hard for me. Waking up to the sound of an alarm is one of my least favourite things in the world and I really, really don't enjoy extracting myself from the fluffy warm comfort of bed. Inevitably though life has to go on, deadlines need to be met and the day has to be started and over the years of trying desperately to become a morning person there are a few little tricks I've picked up that really help to make a difference.  No-brainer steps like fuelling yourself properly for the day by opting for a more filling and nutritious breakfast than a bowl of sugary cereals or a slice of dry toast as you run out the door always makes a difference, and getting in a little endorphin releasing exercise to help convince yourself that being up before the sun has even risen is a good thing is one of the go to options for many. Before any of this takes place for me though, my first port of call is always skincare. SUPERSTART YOUR SKIN There's something very soothing about taking five minutes out of your morning routine to actually spend time with your skin. I've certainly been guilty of the quick wash, moisturise and go drill more then a few times, but when I actually give myself a chance to get in a proper skincare routine, not only my face but my mind always feel a lot clearer.  When reaching for products in the morning I like to think smart. What can be quick and simple but do the best for my skin? Cleansing of course comes first and although wake up washes might seem most appealing for an easy option, my dry skin prefers something a lot more moisturising like a balm cleanser. Emulsifying formulas are your friend when you have a tight turnaround as they contain all the benefits of a oil based cleanser but can be washed away without the faff of having to find a fresh muslin cloth.  Then comes the layering of products for hydration. Oils, serums, creams and lotions - there's a whole lot to think about. Adding in yet another product may seem counter productive to keeping skincare simple but when that one product actually boosts the efficiency of all the others added on top it can be worth it to reach for one more thing.  The Elizabeth Arden SuperSTART Skin Renewal Booster is just such a product. A silky light textured kick start for your skincare that can be smoothed straight onto clean skin to maximise the potential of your other favourites.  The genius little product works on the skin's surface layer to strengthen the moisture barrier that keeps in the radiance. A damaged surface layer can play havoc with your skin's ability to glow. Moisture can't be retained and for those who fall into the dry skin category like myself the effects of this can be felt even more with dull lifeless skin that just doesn't look healthy.  I noticed a difference even after the very first use of SuperSTART after following with a serum and moisturiser as normal. My skin had honestly never felt smoother or more plumped which also translated into some breezy make up application - another bonus for keeping my mornings running smoothly. The long term effects after consistent use have definitely been an evening of my skin tone, and whether that's down to SuperSTART working magic on it's own or allowing my regular set up of products to work to the fullest unhindered, I'm seriously enjoying the results. <> beauty
